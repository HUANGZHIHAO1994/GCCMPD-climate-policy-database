This scheme aims to promote energy efficiency and energy consumption monitoring in energy-intensive facilities (those consuming more than 500 toe/year), thus broadening the scope of the previous RGCE (which applied to facilities consuming over 1000 toe/year). The SGCIE imposes binding energy audits, with a 6-year periodicity, in energy-intensive facilities with consumption above 1000 toe/year. An 8-year periodicity for energy audits is applied to facilities with energy consumption between 500 and 1000 toe/year. Facilities operators are obliged to conduct an energy audit and elaborate an Energy Consumption Rationalization Plan (PREn), establishing targets for energy and carbon intensity and specific energy consumption, which also outlines energy rationalization measures. The Plan must be submitted to the DGEG through an online system (www.adene.pt/SGCIE) to the Directorate General for Energy and Geology (DGEG), as well as submit as biennial execution and progress reports. Upon DGEG's approval, as the competent authority that supervises and inspects the SGCIEs operation, the PREn become a Rationalization Agreement for Energy Consumption (ARCE). The ARCE provides facility operators with excise dutiy exemptions (ISP) on oil and energy products (coal, oil coke, fuel oil and oil gases), as well as possibility to apply for incentives on energy audit costs and on investments in energy management and monitoring equipment.

{"Policy": "Perform, Achieve, Trade (PAT) Scheme", "Policy_Content": "The Perform, Achieve, Trade (PAT) scheme was establihed by National Mission for Enhanced Energy Efficiency. It is regulatory instrument to reduce specific energy consumption in energy intensive industries, with an associated market based mechanism to enhance the cost effectiveness through certification of excess energy saving which can be traded.  The first cycle of the PAT Scheme (2012-2015) managed to reduce the energy consumption of more than 400 energy-intensive enterprises (known as Designated Consumers  -DCs) by 5.3%, above the initial target of 4.1%. The targets were originally established based on annual specific energy consumption for each DC in 2010 (baseline year) and adjusted to account for factors such as product mix, capacity utilisation, change in fuel quality, import/export of power and other factors.Following the evaluation of the first cycle, all sectors surpassed their targets except for the thermal power generation sector, which had the highest target of the 8 subsectors covered under the PAT programme. The reason for this was mainly due to the unavailability of new efficient natural gas power plants and partly due to lower than expected electricity demand from the thermal generation sector, which subsequently led to a reduction in power plant performance.Overall, majority of the DCs implemented relatively low cost measures, such as changes to process control and installation of variable speed drives on electric motors, which were financed through the DCs own resources. In terms of sector specific interventions, for example, in the cement industry the most common measures covered installation of waste heat recovery systems and vertical rolling mills. In the iron and steel sector, measures included installation of top recovery turbines and adoption of coke dry quenching process.The trading of energy saving certificates (ESCerts) is central to the PAT programme and serves as an incentive to reach or surpass the mandatory targets. The ESCerts, equivalent to 1 tonne of oil equivalent (toe) of energy savings, are given based on quantified energy savings verified by an accredited energy auditor. The ESCerts are awarded after a DC surpasses its target and can then be sold to another DC that has failed to achieve its target, the price for which is determined through market supply and demand. The ESCerts can also be banked for next PAT cycles of the respective DC to contribute towards meeting future targets as the PAT programme expands.The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission acts as the market regulator by defining the regulatory framework for trading of the ESCerts, while the Power System Operation Corporation is responsible for the centralized ESCert registry. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency is the administrator and developed a platform to manage the ESCert trading process. Starting from April 2017, the Indian Energy Exchange and the Power Exchange of India will manage ESCert trading (until now no ESCerts had been traded). The demand for ESCerts is expected to be relatively low, given that about 3.8 million ESCerts have been issued of which about 1.5 million need to be absorbed by the DCs who are falling short of targets.If a DC has not met its target and fails to purchase sufficient ESCerts to compensate for its shortfall, it will be subject to a penalty. The penalty for non-compliance is 1 million INR (about 15 000 USD) plus the value of the energy savings that have not been obtained by the DC, measured in toe. The price of 1 toe is determined by a combination of coal, fuel, gas and electricity prices as declared by the Indian government. For example, the cost of coal is based on the price of F-grade coal declared by the Ministry of Coal multiplied by the amount of coal consumed by the 478 DCs and the total energy consumed in the 478 DCs. In 2011-2012, the market value of 1 toe was approximately 10 154 INR (approximately 151 USD) and in 2014-2015 it was 10 968 INR (approximately 160                                                                                                   ", "law or strategy": "Preparatory Instruments"}

Net metering is designed for applications where the renewable energy generation is not being used as a back-up to the main source of power supply. Instead, the excess energy is supplied to the Distribution Utility, on the assumption that the amount of energy supplied to the grid will not exceed the amount purchased over an annual tracking period.  It is planned, that only renewable energy generators with capacity up to 200 kW will be able to benefit from the net metering support.", "law or strategy": "Preparatory Instruments"}

This document will assign an energy performance label to residential and service buildings and list measures for improving the energy performance of these properties, thus increasing energy savings by 20 to 40% and reducing subsequent CO2 emissions. The energy label allows the residential or service units to be classified on an efficiency scale ranging from A+ (high energy efficiency) to G (poor efficiency). This is similar to the scale used for some domestic equipment and appliances and allows for easy reading and interpretation by the consumer. The cost of issuing a certificate by a qualified expert varies according to building type and complexity. Its registration is subject to the payment of a variable charge based on the propertys use. As of July 2007, all non-residential buildings required an Energy Certificate. As of 1 July 2008, this applies to all new buildings, which must obtain a at least a B classification. All buildings will require certification from January 1 2009. The SCE also involves a management support system, in the form of a website, which provides information on the certification process and an advertising campaign \"Lets save energy to save Portugal\".

{"Policy": "Energy Strategy 2050", "Policy_Content": "Energy Strategy 2050: The ES2050 aims at further boosting renewable energies in order to reach the following indicative electricity generation targets: 4400 GWh (excluding hydro) by 2020, 11400 GWh (excluding hydro) by 2035; 37400 GWh average yearly hydro production by 2035. The main levers are a - time-limited \u2013 funding increase (by increasing the grid surcharge cap for electricity) and increased CO2 levy proceeds (which are partly allocated - with cantonal co-funding - for heating from renewable sources in buildings).  Keeping overall renewable funding under control has been an important policy goal since the introduction of a feed-in tariff[1] in 2009 (and also in earlier policies). This has been achieved by capping the grid surcharge (albeit increasing it in successive steps from 0.45 cent/kWh in 2012 to 0.6 cent in 2014, 1.1 cent in 2015, 1.3 cent in 2016, 1.5 cent in 2017).  A new element of the ES2050 are sunset clauses for the different measures: end 2022 for the hydropower market premium and new commitment of feed-in premiums, end 2025 for the Building Refurbishment Programme (and its renewable heating component), end 2030 for investment aid. On 4 September 2013 the Federal Council submitted to Parliament the first set of measures in the Energy Strategy 2050. The Council wishes to significantly develop the existing potential for energy efficiency and exploit the potential of hydro power and the new renewable energies (sun, wind, geothermal, biomass). The remaining 5 nuclear reactors remain in operation as long as they are technically safe. The Federal Council stated explictly, that no new reactors should be built in Switzerland and proposed a legal prohibition to build new reactors in Switzerland. The set of measures entails a total revision of the Energy Law as well as changes in various other Federal laws. Parliament approved the law proposal on 30 September 2016, Swiss voters followed suit on 21 May 2017. The first set of measures in Energy Strategy 2050 aims at increasing energy efficiency and promoting the development of renewable energies. Most of the measures planned by the Federal Council require enacting changes to the law in Parliament. In the course of the consultations on this subject Parliament has rejected certain of these measures, which will, therefore, no longer be mentioned below. However, other measures have been introduced by Parliament. Building Refurbishment Programme: Additional funding will be added to the Building Programme, which started in 2010. The programme subsidises the cost of the energy-saving building renovations and is partially financed by revenues from the CO2 levy on fuels with the rest financed by the Swiss Cantons (=26 federal states). Tax incentives for building renovation: With the implementation of new Energy Act, it will be possible to deduct the costs of a building demolition from federal and cantonal income taxation to make way for a new building. Together with the costs of energy-related improvements, demolition costs can be deducted also in the next two tax periods if it is not possible to fully offset the expenditure in the year in which it was carried out. Emissions standards for vehicles: The Energy Strategy 2050 provides for a tightening up of the current emissions specifications for vehicles. As a consequence, the accepted limit for CO2/km emissions for all new passenger vehicles on the road will be reduced to an average of 95 g CO2/km by the end of 2020. New standards will also be extended to new Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV), which will be limited to an average of 147 g CO2/km by the end of 2020. Both measures have been taken in accordance with EU law. Due to the lack of vehicle producers in Switzerland the importers are the obligated parties. Competitive tenders: Programmes and projects which contribute towards more economical electricity consumption in industry, the services sector and households are supported by competitive tenders. The promotional subsidies are awarded by auction. In this way projects and programmes with the best cost-benefit ratio get a chance to participate. The financing is covered by the electric grid surcharge that electricity consumers pay to promote renewable energies and energy efficiency. These promotional subsidies for competitive tenders are available until the year 2030 at the latest.", "law or strategy": "Law/Act"}

Executive departments and agencies (agencies) have been among our Nation's leaders as the United States works to build a clean energy economy that will sustain our prosperity and the health of our people and our environment for generations to come. Federal leadership in energy, environmental water, fleet, buildings, and acquisition management will continue to drive national greenhouse gas reductions and support preparations for the impacts of climate change. Through a combination of more efficient Federal operations such as those outlined in this Executive Order (order), we have the opportunity to reduce agency direct greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40 percent over the next decade while at the same time fostering innovation, reducing spending, and strengthening the communities in which our Federal facilities operate.  It therefore continues to be the policy of the United States that agencies shall increase efficiency and improve their environmental performance. Improved environmental performance will help us protect our planet for future generations and save taxpayer dollars through avoided energy costs and increased efficiency, while also making Federal facilities more resilient. To improve environmental performance and Federal sustainability, priority should first be placed on reducing energy use and cost, then on finding renewable or alternative energy solutions. Pursuing clean sources of energy will improve energy and water security, while ensuring that Federal facilities will continue to meet mission requirements and lead by example. Employing this strategy for the next decade calls for expanded and updated Federal environmental performance goals with a clear overarching objective of reducing greenhouse gas emissions across Federal operations and the Federal supply chain.

{"Policy": "Feed-in tariffs for Renewable Energy Resource Generated Electricity", "Policy_Content": "In May 2008, the Ministry of Energy began implementing a feed-in tariff system to promote the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources. Grid system operators are obliged to connect plants generating electricity from renewable energy sources and guarantee priority purchase, transmission and distribution of all electricity from wind, biomass and hydro energy sources. Grid operators must pay a tariff agreed upon between them and the power producer, subject to the maximum tariffs and maximum capacities specified below. Power producers and grid system operators may, by contract, digress from the priority of purchases, should this mean better integration of the plant into the grid system. In this case approval must be obtained from the Energy Regulatory Commission. The maximum tariffs are technology and capacity specific, applying to wind, biomass and hydroelectricity, and will apply for 15 years from the date of the plant's commissioning. Feed-in tariffs are as follows: Wind power:  USD 0.09/kWh maximum tariff up to 50 MW (single wind farm); for capacity greater than 50MW, tariff to be negotiated on a commercial basis. The tariff applies to the first 150MW of wind power capacity developed. Biomass derived electricity:  Up to 40 MW, USD 0.07 maximum firm power tariff (for the first 150MW developed) USD 0.045 maximum non-firm power tariff (for the first 50MW developed); for capacity greater than 40MW, tariff to be negotiated on a commercial basis. Where biomass is used together with fossil fuels for the purpose of producing firm power it must contribute at least 70% of the annual fuel consumption, otherwise the non-firm power tariff shall apply. Small hydro power:  From 50kW to 1MW, maximum firm power tariff of USD 0.12 and non-firm power tariff of USD 0.10 From 1 to 5MW, maximum firm power tariff of USD 0.10 and non-firm power tariff of USD 0.08 From 5 to 10MW, maximum firm power tariff of USD 0.08 and non-firm power tariff of USD 0.06 The tariff applies to the first 100MW of firm power generated, and the first 50MW of non-firm power generated. For capacity greater than 10MW, the tariff is to be negotiated on a commercial basis. Investors interested in becoming power producers must submit an expression of interest (EOI) to the Ministry of Energy. The EOI is reviewed by a panel comprising representatives of the Ministry of Energy, the grid operator and the energy regulator.

{"Policy": "Air Quality Standards United States of America (2013)", "Policy_Content": "HISTORY Ambient air quality on the federal level is regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). US federal legislation on air quality began with the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 and the Clean Air Act (CAA) in 1963. In 1967, the Air Quality Act expanded federal activities and initiated extensive ambient monitoring studies. In 1970, a landmark shift took place with the amendment of the original Clean Air Act, including the establishment of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and State Implementation Plans (SIPs). Enforcement authority was also expanded. More stringent permit review requirements were established in 1977.  On a State level, environmental agencies with air divisions are responsible for regional air quality and for creating and carrying out mandated SIPs within three years of the promulgation of a NAAQS. Under its most recent amendment in 1990, the CAA requires EPA to set NAAQS for all pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. In 1997, EPA established the first annual and 24-hour NAAQS for a new criteria pollutant category, PM2.5.  TECHNICAL STANDARDS Carbon monoxide (CO), lead (Pb), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate pollution (PM10 and PM2.5), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are known as \u201ccriteria pollutants.\u201d The EPA sets both primary standards (designed to protect public health) and secondary standards (designed to protect public welfare including visibility, crops, buildings, etc.)  EPA\u2019s latest scheduled 5-year review of the NAAQS is to be completed in 2013.

The University of Ontario Institute of Technology (UOIT) in Oshawa, Ont., is well on its way to becoming one of Canada's leading centres of learning and research. \"Whether it's the programs or the people or the services or the buildings, we've delivered,\" says Dr. Gary Polonsky, president and vice-chancellor of the university. \"Our students are delighted.\"  The dropout rate has been \"astonishingly\" low, says Dr. Polonsky. \"One of our most profound achievements,\" he adds, \"is to have gotten off to such a great start with happy students. In fact, the very legislation that created UOIT in June 2002 commits UOIT to the success of each individual student - and we take that trust very seriously\".  The University of Ontario Institute of Technology's inaugural class currently numbers 939 students. The university played a significant role in accommodating Ontario's double-cohort, high school graduating class in 2003. The majority of students in the first class are from the GTA and Durham Region, with additional national and international recruitment efforts planned.  UOIT's high student retention rate is a reflection of its first-rate faculty and staff. In the tough competition for talent, the university has single-mindedly pursued top professors who combine four key qualities: a keen interest in students, exceptional teaching skills, brilliant research abilities, and a mastery of technology.  Students are excited, says Dr. Polonsky, by UOIT's distinction as Ontario's first laptop-based university, its state-of-the-art buildings, and the skill professors have in incorporating technology into the classroom to enhance active, team-based, project-based learning. UOIT's mission hinges on offering teaching, research and service at the highest level of excellence - also spelled out in Bill 109. \"All of our schools,\" says Dr. Polonsky, \"offer high-end, research-intensive market-driven, career-oriented professional programs that lead to great careers.\"  To enhance learning, teaching is performed exclusively by experienced faculty, not teaching assistants. In the campus REACH office, eight full-time professionals are available to help students with special needs maximize their learning potential.  But at the University of Ontario Institute of Technology, achieving student success goes beyond the classroom. UOIT is also working to create a beautiful campus and a vibrant student community, with many clubs, teams, and social activities. The university offers top-flight athletic facilities, which will be expanded over the next two years. A new campus tennis facility opened this fall, with clay courts and a bubble for year-round play. UOIT's phased student residence overlooks a river valley, with its two-person suites featuring a private bedroom for each student, as well as a bathroom, kitchenette and sitting area.  In the coming months, UOIT will continue to build on the standard of excellence it has already established, says Dr. Polonsky. In the fall of 2004, the university plans to offer six entirely new programs, including Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Energy Systems Engineering, Bachelor of Health Science (Honours) in Medical Laboratory Science, and Bachelor of Engineering (Honours) in Mechanical Engineering. About 1,250 first-year students are expected next fall, and the university plans to hire more than 20 new faculty. It will complete its first three buildings by fall 2004, including a new library. Two additional academic buildings are slated to open in 2005, as is a twin-pad arena, largely funded by the City of Oshawa. An academic and service building is planned for 2006. The attractive grounds will feature connected interior and exterior walkways, and a reflecting pond that can be used as a skating rink in winter.  UOIT's short history is already marked by tremendous accomplishment. Its founding team worked seven days a week for two years to establish the university, and visited some of the finest institutions across Canada and the U.S. \"to poach the best practices that are out there,\" says Dr. Polonsky. \"I acknowledge the fantastic amount of work that was done by fantastic people in government, in the community and on campus - and I will be grateful to them for all time.\"", "law or strategy": "Other Strategy Plan or Target"}

It puts in place a system for the recalculation of gas losses in distribution networks. Assumed losses based on standard loss rates are compared with real losses estimated after distribution. Thus, distributors must calculate the resulting balance, which is then reviewed by the competent authorities and a system is used to pay users in case of a positive balance (i.e. real losses greater then assumed losses) or charge users in case of a negative balance (i.e. real losses lower than assumed losses).  When the annual balance of losses of a transport carrier is negative, the competent authority will value half of the balance, using the annual average price of gas during that year, as additional remuneration for the carrier (fourth final provision).   The percentage of standard losses by facilities are the following.  a) Primary transportation losses: 0.2% of gas inputs to the primary transportation network (from international connections, reservoirs, regasification plants or from other entry points outside the gas system). b) Distribution losses at pressure equal to or less than 4 bar: 1%. c) Distribution losses at pressure equal to or less than 4 bar, for networks from satellite plants: 2%.  d) Distribution losses at pressure greater than 4 bar: 0.39% (Article 17). No distribution losses in gas pipelines with a maximum design pressure greater than 16 bar, unless its existence is justified.  This regulation thus provides incentives for the reduction of gas losses in distribution systems and, therefore, lower methane leakage. The incentive to reduce transport losses is reviewed each year to update economic valuations (e.g. price of gas) and to reassess loss rates.", "law or strategy": "Decree/Order/Ordinance"}

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is the main certification standard for the use of palm oil and its fractions in food and oleo-chemicals. Currently 20% of palm oil worldwide is RSPO certified. Founded in 2004, it is a multi-stakeholder, non-profit group that unites seven sectors of the palm oil industry in regular dialogue, including investors, growers, retailers and NGOs, using a consensus voting system to develop standards and criteria on an on-going basis. It uses a business-tobusiness model to encourage the adoption of sustainable practices by members (particularly producers) and promotes the uptake of certified sustainable palm oil internationally. While voluntary, it requires that companies abide by national laws and requirements. The Principles and Criteria, which form the basis of the RSPO certification scheme, comprise eight basic principles: Commitment to Transparency; Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations; Commitment to Long\u2013term Economic and Financial Viability; Use of appropriate Best Practices by Growers and Millers; Environmental Responsibility and Conservation of Natural Resources and Biodiversity; Responsible Consideration of Employees and of Individuals and Communities Affected by Growers and Mills; Responsible Development of New Plantings; and Commitment to Continuous Improvement in Key Areas of Activity. In order to claim compliance with the P&C and achieve RSPO certification, growers must be assessed by a third-party RSPO-accredited certification body every five years, with an annual audit for continued compliance. The current P&C can be found here on the RSPO website, with a breakdown of the indicators and guidance on how to become certified. Members of the RSPO must submit Annual Communications of Progress (ACOP) reports in order to assess their progress towards producing and procuring RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil to any of the four supply chain models for RSPO Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO): identity preserved, segregated, mass balance, and book and claim (see here for more information on supply chain models). A crucial component of the ACOPs are Timebound plans (TBPs), in which members must state clear timelines for producing or sourcing 100% RSPO CSPO. RSPO NEXT, which was launched in 2015, is a voluntary commitment in addition to the existing P&Cs and incorporates more stringent assessment standards, with guidelines regarding deforestation, fire, peat, human rights and landscape approaches, among other issues.

Australia revised the BCA to account for energy efficiency as part of its strategic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To complement passage of the housing provisions, Australian governments agreed to implement a consistent Nation-wide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS) to enable householders to assess the energy efficiency of houses and make more informed choices about housing purchases and renovation. For housing: Energy efficiency provisions for detached and semi-detached dwellings were introduced on 1 January 2003. From 1 May 2006, the provisions were increased to a nominal 5 star NatHERS rating. Since the BCA is a performance based Code, builders and designers have the option of meeting these standards in one of two ways: by following the prescriptive deemed-to-satisfy provisions; or by achieving the required house energy rating using an accredited software tool. The Australian Capital Territory Government also required disclosure of the NatHERS rating during the sale or lease of each house.  For residential buildings other than houses:   The development of BCA energy efficiency provisions for commercial buildings has proceeded in two stages: BCA class 2 to 4 buildings and BCA class 5 to 9 buildings. Provisions for Class 2, 3 and 4 buildings (i.e. apartments, hotels) ware developed for inclusion in the BCA on 1 May 2005.

To be eligible for a grant, homeowners must have had an EnerGuide for Houses evaluation of their home done before and after making energy-efficiency improvements. The amount of the grant depended on the difference between the EnerGuide for Houses rating before retrofits and after they are done. The greater the improvement in a homes energy-efficiency rating, the greater the grant. Homeowners had 18 months after the first evaluation is done to have the retrofits completed, complete the second evaluation, and apply for the incentive. As announced in October 2005, the EnerGuide for Houses Retrofit Incentive qualified for additional funding of $170 million under the Canadian governments package of measures to relieve higher energy costs.

The focus of the Notice is on increasing projects\u2019 security, usage of technology emitting fewer emissions, promotion of the boilers among large-scale enterprises and improving the management of the projects. 1. Strengthen the fuel guarantee of the biomass briquette fuel boiler heating demonstration project       Biomass molding fuel boilers use agricultural and forestry biomass molding fuels (granular, rod, block, etc.) as fuel for heating, and supply renewable heat after burning in special biomass molding fuel boilers. It is strictly forbidden to mix and burn urban domestic garbage, waste furniture boards, industrial solid waste and other hazardous waste, as well as fossil fuels such as coal and gangue; it is not allowed to directly burn unformed biomass bulk materials.       The raw materials for the production of biomass briquettes must be agricultural and forestry residues, including crop straws (corn stalks, rice stalks, wheat stalks, cotton stalks, oil crop stalks, etc.), agricultural product processing residues (peanut husks, rice husks, fruit husks, sugarcane slag, furfural slag, fungus bags with plastic packaging removed, etc.) and the \"three leftovers\" of forestry (tending residues, harvesting residues, and processing residues). The crushing rate of biomass briquette fuel shall not exceed 5%, the moisture content shall not exceed 18%, the ash content shall not exceed 8%, the sulfur content shall not exceed 0.1%, and the nitrogen content shall not exceed 0.5%.       2. Improving boiler technical level and emission requirements of biomass briquette fuel boiler heating demonstration project       The boiler used in the biomass briquette fuel boiler heating demonstration project should be a dedicated biomass boiler for burning biomass briquette fuel, and large-scale projects should use advanced circulating fluidized bed boilers. Demonstration projects must be equipped with a secondary dust removal device for cyclone dust removal and bag dust removal, and a continuous monitoring system for flue gas emissions must be installed and operated. For SO2 and NOx that cannot meet the emission requirements stably, desulfurization and denitrification facilities should be installed.       Strictly control the emission of air pollutants from boilers. According to the requirements of Guoneng Xinneng [2014] No. 295 document, the emission concentrations of soot, SO2, and NOx in the demonstration projects should be less than 30mg/m3, 50mg/m3, and 200mg/m3 respectively, and the emissions should be further strictly controlled, reaching or better than Natural gas emission standards (when converting the benchmark oxygen content emission concentration, it is tentatively implemented at 9%; the chimney height refers to the natural gas standard, and the specific height is determined according to the approved environmental impact assessment document). For demonstration projects built in key areas, the emission concentrations of soot, SO2, and NOx should reach the special emission limits for natural gas. For projects with a high level of clean emissions, priority will be included in demonstration projects.       3. Vigorously promote the investment and construction of biomass briquette fuel boiler heating demonstration projects by powerful large-scale enterprises       The biomass briquette fuel boiler heating demonstration project should adopt a professional investment, construction and operation model, that is, enterprises specializing in biomass thermal power will invest in the construction of biomass briquette fuel boiler heating projects and be responsible for operation and management services to improve the biomass briquette fuel boiler supply. Hot professional marketization level. At present, the demonstration projects mainly focus on the construction and operation of boiler projects by specialized enterprises for heat-consuming customers, and the self-built and self-operated boiler projects of heat-using enterprises or units are not considered for the time being. Actively promote the application of biomass briquette fuel boiler heating in chemical industry, machinery, medicine, food, papermaking and other industrial fields with large heat consumption, as well as the application of civil heating where conditions permit, and give priority to the construction of demonstration projects in these fields.       Through the construction of demonstration projects, accelerate the cultivation and development of large-scale enterprises for biomass briquette fuel boiler heating, and develop and expand the private economy of biomass energy heating. Support powerful enterprises to invest in multiple projects across regions, especially centralized heating in industrial parks and industrial agglomeration areas and large-scale industrial heating projects, to form economies of scale, increase industrial concentration, and enhance the development potential of biomass briquette fuel boiler heating level and quality. Actively support enterprises to expand the renewable energy heating market and increase the proportion of renewable energy heating.       4. Strengthen the construction of biomass briquette fuel boiler heating industry system       Establish a green and low-carbon industrial chain. According to the heating demand of biomass briquette fuel boilers and the conditions of agricultural and forestry biomass resources, establish a biomass briquette fuel boiler industry chain including biomass raw material collection, briquette fuel production, transportation, boiler construction, and thermal services. On the basis of a stable and reliable raw material collection system, a small-scale, multi-point layout will be built to build a certain-scale briquette fuel production base, and a socialized logistics product distribution system will be configured to form an integrated, coordinated, efficient, green and low-carbon industrial chain.       Establish and improve the industry standard system. Combined with the construction of demonstration projects, accelerate the construction of the energy industry standard system including biomass briquette fuel product standards, briquette equipment standards, biomass briquette fuel boiler standards, biomass briquette fuel boiler heating engineering standards and operation service standards, and improve biomass The technical level of the molding fuel boiler heating industry, where conditions permit, on the basis of demonstration projects, formulate and issue corresponding local standards as soon as possible. Combined with the actual situation of the construction of demonstration projects and the prevention and control of air pollution in various places, the local standards for the emission of air pollutants from biomass briquette fuel boilers have been introduced.       Establish a testing and certification system. Combined with the construction of demonstration projects, coordinate the construction of an industrial standard system, and establish a biomass briquette fuel heating testing certification, including biomass briquette fuel product certification, production base certification, equipment certification, boiler heating engineering certification, enterprise certification, and thermal service certification system, establish an industry-wide testing and certification mechanism, and improve the level of industry construction and management. To speed up the implementation of certification for demonstration projects, provincial development and reform commissions (energy bureaus) should urge demonstration projects to actively cooperate with the certification pilot and fully implement the certification system. Actively explore the mechanism of industry self-management and self-improvement under marketization conditions, and accelerate the construction of industry self-discipline system.       5. Strengthen the management of biomass briquette fuel boiler heating projects       Strictly manage the biomass briquette fuel boiler heating project. For the biomass briquette fuel boiler heating demonstration projects declared by professional investment, construction and operation enterprises, the provincial development and reform commission (Energy Bureau) will file for the project, issue a demonstration project filing approval document, establish a green channel, and speed up the filing progress. Multiple projects declared by the same project legal person in the same area can be bundled for filing to improve filing efficiency; provincial environmental protection departments (bureaus) conduct environmental impact assessment reviews on projects and issue environmental impact assessment approval documents. When filing, focus on reviewing project fuels and their stable sources, biomass boiler heating technology solutions, and boiler pollutant discharge requirements. Before the introduction of energy industry or local biomass briquette fuel heating industry standards, local standards for biomass boiler pollutant discharge, and the establishment of a testing and certification system, all localities should focus on the construction and management of demonstration projects and strictly manage non-demonstration projects .       Strengthen the supervision and management of demonstration projects. The first is to strengthen public supervision, and adopt Internet publicity, project site publicity, etc. to publish project information, especially the information on pollutant discharge control, and accept supervision from all walks of life; The construction projects of the technical plan and the projects whose boiler pollutant discharge does not meet the corresponding requirements cannot be put into operation; the third is to strengthen the supervision of investment, construction and operation enterprises, and establish a blacklist system. For issues such as excessive emissions and violations of laws and regulations, take corresponding measures such as prohibiting the company from investing in and constructing such projects in the region; the fourth is to do a good job in special government supervision, and strengthen the quality, safety, and environmental protection of biomass briquettes during project construction and operation.

It outlined plans for reform in the transport sector, including electronic tolls, taxes on workplace parking, and initiatives aimed at reducing fuel consumption. Proceeds from new income streams were to be used within local transport plans to enhance traffic management and greatly improve public transport policies.     Three key themes to emerge from the White Paper in relation to climate change were:   - Improving fuel efficiency of road transport, for example through increases in road fuel duties.   - Reducing car dependence, especially in urban areas, through better planning and promotion of public transport, cycling and walking.   - Recognising that measures may be needed to manage or restrain road traffic, especially in urban areas.

The law came into force as of 1 January 2021. It seeks to help ensure that both electricity supply and electricity consumption become carbon-neutral before 2050. To this end, the law specifies the pace at which sustainable energy such as wind and photovoltaics are to be expanded over the next few years.  For the first time, the 2021 Renewable Energy Sources Act provides for annual monitoring, which can be used to make adjustments if necessary. Germany\u2019s renewable energy levy, the surcharge in consumers\u2019 electricity bills that goes to support renewables, will be EUR 0.065 (USD 0.077) per kWh next year, reduced from EUR 0.06756 in 2020. Average households will see power prices fall by 1%. German consumers can look forward to lower energy bills next year after a reduction in a surcharge they pay to support renewable power. The transmission grid companies -- which include Elia\u2019s 50Hertz, Dutch Tennet, EnBW\u2019s Transnet BW and Amprion -- said the cap on the surcharge at 6.5 cents would require 10.8 billion euros of federal support payments.  The government also decided that the fee would fall further to 6.0 cents in 2022 to relieve customers from cost burdens in the fight against the economic fallout from the coronavirus. The Federal Cabinet passed the amendment to the Renewable Energy Sources Act, the so-called EEG amendment 2021. The amendment to the Federal Requirements Plan Act with regulations on the expansion of the electricity grid was also passed in the cabinet. With regard to coal mine methane emissions, this act provides a guaranteed fixed payback tariff for 20 years through feed-in tariffs or fees paid for electricity produced from previously approved Coal Mine Methane (CMM) or Abandoned Mine Methane (AMM) projects (Sec. 25). CMM operators have the authority to sell the carbon credits generated by the project and have the added incentive of paying no local taxes or royalties on CMM projects. This act also provides a framework for integrating CMM to the grid (Sec. 8) by requiring grid system operators to quickly connect installations for the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources and from mine gas to their grid at a suitable point.  Update 26 November 2021: In order to meet its renewable energy targets, the Federation and the L\u00e4nder established a new Bund/L\u00e4nder Cooperation Committee under the Renewable Energy Sources Act.

Introduction  This is an internally generated policy based on extensive consultations within the Federated States of Micronesia designed to address the pressing needs of the country in relation to climate change and disaster risk management.  This policy will also assist in meeting regional and international treaty obligations and objectives that the Government of FSM has agreed are worth pursuing such as the Pacific Disaster Risk Reduction and Disaster Management Framework for Action 2005-2015 (RFA), the Pacific Islands Framework for Action on Climate Change 2006-2015 (PIFACC), the international Hyogo Framework for Action: Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to Disasters 2005 -2015, and the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).  Background  This policy has been developed in recognition of the need to safeguard the development of FSM's people, resources and economy, now and in the future, to the risks posed by a changing climate and the range of natural and human-made hazards to which the country is exposed. This is tobe achieved through the pro-active integration of disaster risk reduction, climate change adaptation and climate change mitigation (henceforth referred to as 'greenhouse gas emissions reduction') considerations into relevant national, sectoral, state and community-level development strategies and programs.  At the same time the policy recognizes climate change may provide opportunities to embark on more sustainable development pathways making use of new approaches and technologies that are climate and environment friendly. In this way the policy further recognizes the intrinsic inter- relationships that exist between development activities, people's well-being and the state of the environment.  Guiding Principles  A'multi-hazard' risk management approach that integrates disaster risk management, climate change adaptation and greenhouse gas emissions reduction.  Recognition that the assessment and treatment of existing risks is the starting point for reducing and managing future risks.  Innovative and creative thinking to seek approaches that simultaneously reduce threats and identify possible opportunities arising from climate change.  Strong horizontal and verticaI coordination between sectors, national, state and community levels using an 'all-of-government', 'all-of-countrY' coordinated approach that emphasizes partnerships between the public sector, private sector and civil society.  Knowledge-based decision making with an emphasis on understanding and addressing root causes of hazards and vulnerabilities and using a science-based,no regrets and precautionary approach.  Holistic,integrated, community and ecosystem based 'ridge to reef' approach to risk reduction and natural resources management to ensure that adaptation measures are socially and ecologically sound.  Special attention to gender issues and the needs of marginalized groups, such as small atoll communities, the disabled and the elderly.  Recognizing the rights of island communities to their ancestral lands, while acknowledging the role that migration has played, and will continue to play, as an adaptation strategy to a changing environment.  Implementing the concept of 'building back better' as part of recovery and reconstruction programs following loss and damage caused by natural and human-induced disasters.  Goal  The goal of this policy is to promote development that proactively integrates the management of disaster and climate related hazards by investing in disaster risk management, climate change adaptation and greenhouse gas emissions reduction in pursuit of a safe, resilient and sustainable future for our country.

PACT(1) promotes international intermodal transport through commercially innovative ideas. A total amount of \u20ac 7.5 million will be shared between 17 selected projects. The PACT programme will come to an end on 31 December 2001 and will be replaced by the new promotion programme \"Marco Polo\", currently being prepared by the Commission. \"PACT has shown that practical support actions of the Community for modal shift make a real contribution to a more balanced transport system. The Commission now wants to give an even higher priority to concrete measures shifting trucks from road to other modes\", said Loyola de Palacio, in charge of energy and transport policy. \"The planned promotion programme \"Marco Polo\", setting up 'maritime highways', and measures to improve standardisation in intermodal transport are part and parcel of this new strategy.\"  The main goal of the PACT programme is to foster commercially innovative ideas for combined transport. Combined transport shifts containers and similar units off the road after the start of a journey and onto the rail, inland waterway or short sea shipping modes - before returning them to the road at the very end of the journey. The PACT programme thus helps promote socially and environmentally sustainable transport. PACT projects must be viable on their own after a maximum of three years' funding.  The Commission has reduced the total number of subsidised projects - from 21 in 2000 to 17 this year - and increased the average funding intensity per project to \u20ac 441 176. This will improve the effectiveness of the programme and the ultimate viability of each individual action. The budget available for projects this year is \u20ac 7.5 million. It is shared out as follows:  Rail-related projects:    44% Short sea projects:     29% Inland waterway projects:   13% Projects involving several modes:  13% Feasibility studies:    1% As projects involving several modes heavily rely on waterborne transport, the actual share of all waterborne transport in this year's funding package is approximately 54%. This reflects the Commission's determination to enhance the role of short sea and inland waterway transport in the intermodal transport chain. The selected actions should relieve congested road corridors by about 5 billion tonne-kilometres.  More about the selected PACT projects  Rail sector: 7 PACT projects. Combined transport operators propose differentiated services and a more efficient use of existing facilities and capacity. Especially noteworthy is the launch of new combined transport services using private rail traction on the Brenner axis linking Germany and Italy. Short sea shipping: 5 PACT projects. One project will improve links between the peripheral region of Scotland with the economic centres of Europe. Short sea shipping actions also reduce road traffic on heavily utilised corridors through the ecologically sensitive regions of the Alps and the Pyrenees. One project will demonstrate the commercial viability of short distance services. Another will explore possibilities to adapt short sea shipping better to customer demands in the supply chain. Inland waterways: 2 projects. If successful, these two projects will for the first time provide a strategy for high-quality intermodal barge services from Rotterdam down to Budapest. Multimodal: 2 projects use several modes. One of these innovative projects will transport steel in intermodal loading units from Finland to the centre of Europe via maritime and inland waterway transport. The other will offer a sea-river transportation service between Castillia in Spain and Germany via Oporto in Portugal, using the recently updated infrastructure on the Douro river. One feasibility study explores how transport carbon dioxide emissions can be more effectively reduced through combined transport options. This is the final selection procedure in the current PACT programme, which comes to an end in December 2001.

This royal decree supersedes Royal Decree 436/2004 of March 2004, establishing new tariffs and premiums for each kind of facility covered and incorporating renewable energy, waste to energy, hybrid systems and cogeneration plants into the special regime. The cost of the regime is borne by the grid operator, who can pass on costs to consumers. The grid operators costs are balanced monthly, and where there is a deficit this is covered by the National Energy Committee (CNE). The new scheme generally applies to all technologies, with technology-specific and capacity-specific limits, as well as a combined feed-in tariff and feed-in premium scheme. Facilities with high system efficiency, or that use reactive energy, receive a bonus. Renewable energy facilities are covered by the special regime only if their installed capacity does not exceed 100 MW (50 MW for hydro facilities). Up to 50MW, operators can choose between receiving a feed-in tariff price, or a feed-in premium paid on top of the market electricity price. The feed-in tariffs are paid during the entire time of a systems operation, though these are reduced after a specified number of years.  This period is 25 years PV, ocean and hydro systems, 20 years for wind and geothermal, and 15 years for biomass systems.  Between 50 and 100MW, operators receive a bonus amount for the electricity produced. Solar PV systems are exempt from this arrangement; they receive guaranteed feed-in tariffs which are adjusted every quarter for new systems. In September 2008, new tariffs and a new cap were established for solar PV. Systems registered prior to 29 September 2008 are eligible for a feed-in tariff of between approximately EUR cents 23/kWh and EUR cents 44/kWh (depending on system size). The installation cap of 371MW established by the law has been adjusted upwards to 500MW as of 2009, while the feed-in tariff has been reduced to EUR cents 32/kWh for ground systems and EUR cents 34/kWh for rooftop systems. A registry of systems eligible to receive the new tariffs has been established as of January 2009. Guarantees for processing new applications: The decree provides that those requesting new production facilities in the special regime must present a guarantee for an amount equivalent to EUR 500/kW for the photovoltaic facilities or EUR 20/kW for all other facilities. Facilities holding a certificate for the definitive start-up of service before 1 January 2008 that opt to transfer, before 1 January 2009, electricity to the system in return for a regulated tariff will continue to be covered by Royal Decree 436/2004 for the lifetime of that facility. Facilities holding a certificate for the definitive start up of service before 1 January 2008 that opt to sell, before 1 January 2009, energy on the market will also continue to be covered by Royal Decree 436/2004 - until 31 December 2012.

{"Policy": "Carbon Dioxide Capture and Storage Initiative Canada (2001)", "Policy_Content": "Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a clean energy technology that aims to capture emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), a greenhouse gas (GHG), before they are released into the atmosphere from fossil-fuelled power plants and industrial facilities. The technology has the potential to help Canada balance the importance of energy to our economy with our need to protect the environment.\n\nCCS can be thought of as a system that integrates three sets of technology: CO2 capture, transport and geologic storage. Currently, CCS is applied mainly to facilities that produce energy and process fuels from coal and natural gas. There are also opportunities to integrate CCS in other CO2-emitting energy production and industrial facilities such as power plants, bitumen upgraders, oil refineries and steel, cement and fertilizer production plants.\n\nCanada is a world leader in CCS and is committed to exploring this technology. The development of CCS is one component of a broad suite of measures that the Government of Canada is pursuing to meet our GHG emission reduction targets.\n\nThe global consensus is that multiple CCS demonstration projects are needed, right away, to fully prove the technology and lower its costs before it can be fully commercialized. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), CCS is the only technology available to mitigate GHG emissions from large-scale fossil fuel use. The IEA suggests that CCS could account for about 20 percent of the global GHG reductions needed by 2050, according to a least-cost scenario to limit the global temperature rise to 2\u00b0C.\n\nCanada, with its world-class geological storage potential for CO2, is doing its part to demonstrate CCS technology. The Weyburn project in Saskatchewan \u2013 one of the first large-scale efforts in the world \u2013 was launched in 2000, followed by the adjacent Midale project in 2005. These projects involve capturing CO2 emissions in North Dakota, transporting the CO2 across the Canada-United States border and delivering it for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) operations. This Weyburn-Midale site also serves as the location for the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project. Canada is a founding member of this research initiative. Along with its many private and public sector partners, Canada is contributing to one of the largest international CO2 measuring, monitoring and verification projects in the world.\n\nIn addition to their contributions to the International Energy Agency Greenhouse Gas Weyburn-Midale CO2 Monitoring and Storage Project, Canadian governments have committed around $1.8 billion to CCS initiatives over the last few years, which could lead to up to four large-scale demonstration projects in Canada. This funding is provided through several federal and provincial programs, such as the Government of Canada\u2019s Clean Energy Fund and the Government of Alberta\u2019s Carbon Capture and Storage Fund. The governments of Saskatchewan, British Columbia and Nova Scotia have also provided funding.\n\nCanadian governments are also investing in smaller CCS demonstration projects and studies to advance knowledge, particularly  in the area of new capture processes,  storage site characterization and CO2 monitoring.\n\nCanada is engaged internationally on CCS, through the IEA, the Carbon Sequestration Leadership  Forum, and as a founding member of the Global CCS Institute.\n\nCanada is also working with the United States, through the U.S.-Canada  Clean Energy Dialogue, to advance technical collaboration on research, development and demonstration, enable further dialogue on CCS policies and practices, and share best practices on CCS communications and public engagement.", "law or strategy": "Steering Instruments"}

They clearly demonstrate China\u2019s determination to support the adoption of PV.  \u00b7         The BIPV subsidy program:  In March 2009, China announced its first solar subsidy program, the BIPV (Building-integrated photovoltaics) subsidy program, offering upfront RMB20/watt for BIPV systems and RMB15/watt for rooftop systems.  China\u2019s Ministry of Housing and Urban-Rural Development announced a stimulus plan for BIPV applications in mid-April, offering RMB 20/watt for construction material- and component-based BIPV projects and RMB 15/watt for rooftop- and wall-based projects. On July 2009, the media reported that 111 rooftop-based or BIPV projects nationwide with a combined capacity of 91 MW have been allocated subsidies totaling nearly RMB 1.2 billion.  The Golden Sun Program:  In 2009, China\u2019s Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Science and Technology and the National Energy Administration of the National Development and Reform Commission, announced the launch of the Golden Sun Demonstration Project, the second national solar subsidy program, on July 21, 2000[v].   The project is to facilitate the growth and expand the scale of the PV power generation industry. The effort will be made through fiscal subsidies, scientific and technological support, and market incentives to accelerate the industrialization of PV technological and enable large scale development of the PV industry.[vi] The summary of this project is listed below[vii]:  1.       The government will subsidize 50 percent of investment for solar power projects as well as relevant power transmission and distribution systems that connect to grid networks.  2.       For independent photovoltaic power generating systems in remote regions that have no power supply, the subsidy will rise to 70 percent, the ministry said in an announcement on its web site.  3.       Grid companies are required to buy all surplus electricity output from solar power projects that generate primarily for the developers\u2019 own needs, at similar rates to benchmark on-grid tariffs set for coal-fired power generators.  4.       To qualify for the subsidy, in addition to other requirements, each project must have a generating capacity of at least 300 kilowatt peak, while construction will have to be completed in one year and operations will have to last for at least 20 years.  5.       The government plans to install more than 500 megawatts of solar power pilot projects in two to three years.  6.       The total generating capacity in such pilot projects in each province in principle should not exceed 20 megawatts [GLF note: a most interesting target considering that for the full 500 MW of subsidized project to be deployed, almost all the provincial-level jurisdictions would need to have such a qualifying solar project].   \u00b7         Feed-In Tariff (FIT)  In addition, a nationwide Feed-in Tariff (TIF) subsidy for large-scale PV system is also anticipated. A feed-in-tariff policy will mandate that China\u2019s two state-owned electricity transmission and distribution companies will subsidize solar companies by paying them above-market rates for the electricity generated from solar sources. However, the timing and details of the FIT subsidy is still quite uncertain. An official at the Energy Research Institute at NDRC revealed that it will take at least two years to decide on a national FIT policy. However, a number of solar companies, including Yingli, Suntech, and LDK Solar have announced large solar projects in the past year that are at least partially dependent on adoption of a national FIT policy. Currently, the Chinese government has set up a benchmark FIT at 1.09 yuan/kWh in the 10 MW Dunhuang solar project.  If a national FIT policy for utility scale-solar plants is adopted, it is predicted that this new type of solar policy will drive much faster growth in the Chinese solar market as compared to China\u2019s existing roof-top subsidy and \u201cGolden Sun\u201d program, which focuses on remote off-grid installations. It is expected that the tariff will fall between US $0.16 and US $0.22 per kilowatt hour of electricity produced at large-scale photovoltaic arrays.  Any feed-in tariff could also provide a particular boost to China-based manufacturers as a result of the government\u2019s controversial \u201cBuy Chinese\u201d procurement policy for domestic infrastructure projects.", "law or strategy": "Preparatory Instruments"}

{"Policy": "Energy efficiency Action Plan European Union (27) (2000)", "Policy_Content": "There is a pressing need to renew commitment both at Community and Member State level to promote energy efficiency more actively. This is especially true when seen in the light of the Kyoto agreement to reduce CO2 emissions, where improved energy efficiency will play a key role in meeting the EU Kyoto target economically. In addition to a significant positive environmental impact, improved energy efficiency will lead to a more sustainable energy policy and enhanced security of supply, as well as to many other benefits. An estimated economic potential for energy efficiency improvement of more than 18% of present energy consumption still exists today in the EU as a result of market barriers which prevent the satisfactory diffusion of energy-efficient technology and the efficient use of energy. This potential is equivalent to over 160 Mtoe, or 1900 TWh, roughly the total final energy demand of Austria, Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Greece and the Netherlands combined. The Action Plan presented below outlines policies and measures for the removal of these barriers and the realisation of this potential. If a proposed indicative target for improvement of energy intensity by an additional one percentage point per year above the estimated yearly baseline change is met, this can realise two-thirds of the available savings potential by the year 2010. This would result in avoided energy consumption of over 100 Mtoe, equivalent to avoided CO2 emissions of almost 200 Mt/year or around 40% of the EU Kyoto commitment1. Meeting the Community-wide target of doubling the use of cogeneration to 18% of EU electricity production by 2010 is expected to lead to additional avoided CO2 emissions of over 65 Mt CO2/year by 20102.

Renewables will become the primary source in the electricity sector together with gas, accounting for 34-38% of consumption (compared with 23% in 2010).<br>6) Primary consumption will fall by about 24% by 2020 compared with the reference scenario (an estimated 4% below 2010 levels); this exceeds the European 20-20-20 targets of -20%, thanks mainly to energy efficiency measures.<br><br>&nbsp;To attain these results, the strategy formulates seven priorities, each with specific supporting measures already set in motion or currently being defined:<br>1) Fostering Energy Efficiency<br>2) Promoting a competitive gas market, integrated with the other European markets and with aligned prices<br>3) Developing renewable in a sustainable way, in order to exceed the European targets (\\20-20-20\\), while at the same time keeping energy bills competitive<br>4) Developing an efficient electricity market fully integrated with the European market; with gradual integration of renewable power production<br>5) Restructuring the refining industry and the fuel distribution network, to achieve a more sustainable system competitive on the European level<br>6) Sustainably raising national hydrocarbons production, which will bring major economic and employment benefits, while observing the highest international standards in terms of security and environmental protection<br>7) Modernising governance of the energy sector to make decision-making processes more effective and more efficient<br>8) Research and development will play a key role in developing technologies that allow for a more competitive and sustainable energy system<br><br>&nbsp;The NES lays down long-term indicative objectives for 2050. Among the most important:<br>1) The need to strengthen efforts in energy efficiency. Primary consumption will have to fall in the range of 17-26% by 2050 compared to 2010, by decoupling economic growth from energy consumption. In particular, efforts in building and transport will be critical<br>2) The high penetration of renewable energy, than in any of the scenarios envisaged at the time is expected to reach levels of at least 60% of gross final consumption by 2050, with much higher levels in the electricity sector. In addition to the need of research and development for the reduction of costs, it will be fundamental to rethinking the market and network infrastructure<br>3) A substantial increase in the degree of electrification, which will almost double by 2050, reaching at least 38%, particularly in electricity and transport<br>4) The key role of gas for the energy transition, despite a reduction of its weight both in percentage and in absolute value in the span of the scenario</div>", "law or strategy": "Decree/Order/Ordinance"}

As an example of completed assessments initial savings, eight plants have reported a total of $1 million in immediate savings in the first 30 days of implementing DOE recommendations. The first 61 energy-saving assessments of industrial facilities have identified, in aggregate, nearly $200 million per year in potential energy cost savings and could reduce natural gas consumption by over 22 trillion Btu per year, equivalent to the natural gas consumed by more than 300,000 homes annually. Approximately 3,500 plants were contacted based on publicly available data that DOE used to identify the most energy-intensive plants in the United States. DOE offered another round of Energy Saving Assessments for industrial facilities during the fall of 2006. Energy Saving Teams visited selected large industrial facilities to assess their steam or process heating systems.

This report summarises the evidence received from the stakeholders consulted, identifying the potential benefits and disbenefits that were reported and highlighting key issues affecting the decision. The report begins by setting out the background and context to the Call for Evidence, and by providing short descriptions of the vehicle and exhaust treatment technologies affected by sulphur in fuels.  The European Commission today adopted a proposal to introduce sulphur-free petrol and diesel in every Member State from 1 January 2005. These fuels will speed the introduction of the latest fuel-efficient technologies in cars and other vehicles, significantly reducing emissions of carbon dioxide an important greenhouse gas. From 2011, the use of zero sulphur petrol will be mandatory. A date for zero sulphur diesel fuel becoming mandatory will be fixed as part of a later review. This will considerably reduce emissions of air pollutants from older vehicles and help improve air quality. After adoption of the proposal, Environment Commissioner Margot Wallstr\u00f6m said: \"This is a good day for the environment. The availability of sulphur-free will remove an important technical barrier to the introduction of the most advanced fuel-efficient vehicles. We can now expect significant reductions in emissions of carbon dioxide from new cars, vans, trucks and buses. In addition, these fuels will help clean up the emissions of older more polluting vehicles and improve air quality for people throughout the European Union.\"", "law or strategy": "Preparatory Instruments"}

{"Policy": "Differentiated levy on heavy duty traffic", "Policy_Content": "Heavy duty vehicles pay a levy per km which varies regarding EURO-emission standard. Electric and hydrogen HDV are exempted from the tax. The ultimate goal of the policy is to internalize all external cost of heavy duty transport transiting the Swiss alps and to incentivize the shift to train cargo.  The heavy-duty (> 3.5 tonnes) vehicle fee (HVF) was introduced in 2001. Its prime goal is to internalise external road transport costs. The HVF is calculated on distance, weight and emissions standards, replacing a previous flat fee. Its initial rate was CHF 0.017/tonne/km, rising to CHF 0.025/tonne/km as from 1.1.2005; it will level off at a maximum CHF 0.0275/tonne/km in 2008. Parallel to the rate increases, the maximum lorry weight was lifted to 34 tonnes in 2001 and to 40 tonnes in 2005. This gradual approach gave hauliers time to improve productivity, which partly offset the cost of the HVF. In the first four years since the introduction of the HVF road transport costs have increased by some 6%. Two-thirds of HVF revenues are allocated to construction of rail infrastructure (including two trans-Alpine railway tunnels) to support modal shift. Annual revenues ranged between CHF 800-900 million (EUR 515-580 million) in the first four years and rose to some CHF 1.3 billion (EUR 840 million) in 2005. The HVF resulted from protracted bilateral transport negotiations with the EU. Switzerland was concerned that the lifting of the then prevailing 28- tonne limit on lorries, as demanded by the EU, would unleash massive transit traffic and seriously jeopardize constitutionally mandated modal shift and sustainability policies. The introduction of the HVF was approved by a 57% majority of the Swiss people in 1998. The effects of the HVF (as well as higher truck load limitations) are compelling. Freight mileage decreased 8% in 2001-04 after decade-long uninterrupted growth, while transported freight volumes actually increased. There was virtually no traffic rerouting through neighbouring countries. Transit mileage through the Alps decreased 8%. The decline was the steepest in the first two years due to fleet modernisation and efficiency gains. Provisional data for 2005 indicates a -3% mileage decline because of the rate increase. Modelling indicates that by 2007 CO2 emissions from road freight transport will be 6-8% below what would have happened without the new regime with HVF and higher weight limit. The main effects on transit are expected when high-performance modal shift infrastructure will become operational. Long-term, road freight mileage growth will resume in Switzerland, because of overall European transport trends, albeit more moderately than in the past. However, the share of rail transport in Switzerland is expected to grow from currently 39% to 47% by 2030, thereby reversing past trends.  The current rates are 0.0031 CHF/tkm for Euro 3 trucks and below, 0.00269/tkm for Euro 4 and 5 trucks and 0.0026 CHF/tkm for Euro 6 trucks.", "law or strategy": "Decisional Guidelines, Codes and Frameworks"}

The purpose of this Report is to investigate these recent developments achieved during the 2009 \u2013 2012 Triennium, draw conclusions, prepare recommendation and present them to the world gas industry. However, global, regional and national NGV markets have a range of constant inherent features that should be traced back into history in order to examine near and mid term future trends. These trends are a reliable indicator of the future NGV business course. Due to this link between past and future readers may find in this Report certain repetition of the previous 2003 \u2013 2006 and 2006 \u2013 2009 NGV Study Group Reports. This is unavoidable, although all data are updated as of December 2011. Thus continuity of the study is assured. The specifity of this new study is represented by the fact that it is a result of the joint effort of two international organizations: International Gas Uninon and Economic Comission for Europe of the United Nations. Such joint effort was due to the following. In January 2010 the 20th session of the UN ECE Working Party on Gas has decided to prepare a study on use of natural gas in transport in the UN ECE region. To an extent this study was meant as a follow-up of the study on the Blue Corridor Project published in 2002.  The first coordination meeting of participants was hosted by Gazprom VNIIGAZ in Moscow in spring 2010. Taking into account that almost identical topics are considered within the International Gas Union by basically the same groups of NGV experts, participants of the Moscow meeting have proposed to make one joint NGV study instead of two. Such synergy would allow avoiding an ineffective duplication of work as well as saving time and resources. This proposal has also been supported by the IGU Working Committee 5 and by the Chairman of the IGU Coordination Committee. This explains some emphasis made in the present study on the CNG/NGVs situation and the  market prospects in the European countries and in the UN ECE region in general, e.g. the description of the state and prospects in the countries participating in the GasHighWay project, as well as the NGVA Europe position paper on Minimum infrastructure needs for methane (ng/biomethane) refuelling across Europe.

Significant cost-effective CO2 savings have been identified in the sector, using readily available technologies. The Climate Change Levy, and questions of comfort, health and productivity among workers, are pushing energy issues up the agenda for many businesses. However positive action is impeded by barriers in the commercial property sector, such as conflicts of interest between landlords and tenants, poor information and professional conservatism. These barriers act to limit energy efficiency investment, to the detriment of building occupants and wider society for generations to come. These problems will limit the efficacy of existing initiatives that aim to curb commercial sector energy use. The Association for the Conservation of Energy considers that new legislation is needed.

It is underpinned by the idea that reducing oil dependency reduces the foreign trade deficit, as well as CO2 emissions. Within the framework of European '20-20-20' targets, Portugal established a general target to be achieved by 2020, to reduce primary energy consumption by 25% along with a specific target for Public Administration of achieving a reduction of 30%. As part of the plan to use energy from indigenous renewable sources, Portugal aims to have 31% of final gross energy consumption and 10% of energy for transport derived from renewable sources, at the least possible cost the economy. It also aims to reduce the nation's energy dependence and ensure security of supplies, by promoting a balanced energy mix.   The PNAEE and PNAER establish ways of achieving these targets and international commitments with regard to energy efficiency and the use of energy from renewable sources. In addition to intensifying the goals, the plans also identify existing barriers and the potential for improvement with a view to establishing the most suitable programmes and measures for complying with its commitments.   The revision of the PNAEE is based on three lines of intervention: (i) action (suitability of the measures); (ii) monitoring (review of the methods for monitoring results), and (iii) governance (redefining the PNAEE governance model). To this end, an estimated impact analysis was carried out for all the measures in the PNAEE, in accordance with European norms on monitoring energy efficiency plans and measures. The Resolution aims to operationalise the Energy Efficiency Fund and integrate it with other programmes to support energy efficiency, so as to optimise incentives. The Resolution takes into consideration measures already established by the National Climate Change Programme (PNAC).

The issue of gas flaring has received much attention from petroleum industry regulators in Alberta. Residents living in the vicinity of flares have identified them as sources of odour, smoke, noise and air quality-related health concerns. Sulfur dioxide and carbon dioxide emissions from the flare stacks may contribute to acid rain and the greenhouse effect. The Strosher Report, released by the Alberta Research Council in 1996, has also identified about 250 different compounds in flare emissions, including volatile organic compounds (VOCs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other products of incomplete combustion. The public opposition to solution gas flaring has caused regulators to consider new options designed to reduce the adverse economic and environmental impacts that may be associated with gas flaring. This paper discusses the roles of the Alberta Energy and Utilities Board (EUB) and Alberta Environmental Protection in administering legislation that impacts on gas flaring. In March 1999, the EUB released a guide containing the following five major points regarding gas flaring: (1) implementation of the Clean Air Strategic Alliance's (CASA's) recommendations to eventually eliminate flaring, by starting immediately to reduce flaring, and improve the efficiency of flares, (2) adoption of the CASA schedule of reduction targets for solution gas flaring, (3) conducting a review of the current approval process for small-scale electrical generation systems to encourage co-generation as a productive use of solution gas that is being flared, (4) creating better public notification requirements for new and existing facilities, and (5) discussing conflict resolution between operators and landowners.", "law or strategy": "Steering Instruments"}

{"Policy": "Vehicle Taxation", "Policy_Content": "Vehicles in Austria are subject to two different types of taxes: a fuel consumption tax (Normverbrauchsabgabe/NoVA)) and a car registration tax (Kraftfahrzeugsteuer). The fuel consumption tax NoVa was introduced in 1992. This tax has to be paid at the time of purchasing a new car and is based on the fuel consumption specifications of the car. The Structural Adjustment Act in 1996 led to an increase in this tax rate of about 1% by changing the way fuel consumption is measured. At the same time, the maximum tax rate was raised from 14% to 16%. Since the fuel consumption tax increases the tax burden depending on the vehicle's relative fuel consumption, this measure offers incentives for the purchase of energy-efficient vehicles. In recent years a strong trend towards diesel powered vehicles reduced the average fuel consumption. In 1996 diesel powered vehicles accounted for 50% of all new registrations compared to 22% before the introduction of the fuel consumption levy. Diesel vehicles currently hold a share of 40% to 50% of the total passenger vehicle fleet compared to 5% in the mid-1980s. The car registration tax has to be paid for each month in which a vehicle is registered and has a number-plate, the prerequisite to use public roads. The level of the tax depends on engine specification and it is paid to the insurance company together with the liability insurance premiums.

{"Policy": "Industrial Energy Efficiency Analysis Model", "Policy_Content": "In 1999, the government tested a new concept to increase energy efficiency in industry. The main focus was efficiency in core industrial processes. The programme was designed to detect the energy influence of using different raw materials singly or in combination. The philosophy behind the programme was to increase energy efficiency, reduce the cost of raw materials (feedstock), increase output in production and increase competitiveness in the industry. Pilot projects were carried out in companies that produce: - Non-ECSC ferro-alloys and pulp. - Paper and paperboard. These projects showed that certain materials have a significant impact on specific energy consumption, stability and output of the process. Average energy reduction of electricity was between 5 and 10%, sometimes with little or no capital investment. One of the pilot companies could save 50 GWh/year and thereby save NKr 30 million annually with no investments made. The programme was then continued, with the power intensive industry as the main target.", "law or strategy": "Steering Instruments"}

There is only one planet Earth, yet by 2050, the world will be consuming as if there were three. Global consumption of materials such as biomass, fossil fuels, metals and minerals is expected to double in the next forty years, while annual waste generation is projected to increase by 70% by 2050. As half of total greenhouse gas emissions and more than 90% of biodiversity loss and water stress come from resource extraction and processing, the European Green Deal launched a concerted strategy for a climate-neutral, resource-efficient and competitive economy. Scaling up the circular economy from front-runners to the mainstream economic players will make a decisive contribution to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 and decoupling economic growth from resource use, while ensuring the long-term competitiveness of the EU and leaving no one behind. To fulfil this ambition, the EU needs to accelerate the transition towards a regenerative growth model that gives back to the planet more than it takes, advance towards keeping its resource consumption within planetary boundaries, and therefore strive to reduce its consumption footprint and double its circular material use rate in the coming decade. For business, working together on creating the framework for sustainable products will provide new opportunities in the EU and beyond. This progressive, yet irreversible transition to a sustainable economic system is an indispensable part of the new EU industrial strategy. A recent study estimates that applying circular economy principles across the EU economy has the potential to increase EU GDP by an additional 0.5% by 2030 creating around 700 000 new jobs. There is a clear business case for individual companies too: since manufacturing firms in the EU spend on average about 40% on materials, closed loop models can increase their profitability, while sheltering them from resource price fluctuations. Building on the single market and the potential of digital technologies, the circular economy can strengthen the EU\u2019s industrial base and foster business creation and entrepreneurship among SMEs. Innovative models based on a closer relationship with customers, mass customisation, the sharing and collaborative economy, and powered by digital technologies, such as the internet of things, big data, blockchain and artificial intelligence, will not only accelerate circularity but also the dematerialisation of our economy and make Europe less dependent on primary materials.  For citizens, the circular economy will provide highquality, functional and safe products, which are efficient and affordable, last longer and are designed for reuse, repair, and high-quality recycling. A whole new range of sustainable services, product-as-service models and digital solutions will bring about a better quality of life, innovative jobs and upgraded knowledge and skills. This Circular Economy Action Plan provides a future-oriented agenda for achieving a cleaner and more competitive Europe in co-creation with economic actors, consumers, citizens and civil society organisations. It aims at accelerating the transformational change required by the European Green Deal, while building on circular economy actions implemented since 2015. This plan will ensure that the regulatory framework is streamlined and made fit for a sustainable future, that the new opportunities from the transition are maximised, while minimising burdens on people and businesses. The plan presents a set of interrelated initiatives to establish a strong and coherent product policy framework that will make sustainable products, services and business models the norm and transform consumption patterns so that no waste is produced in the first place. This product policy framework will be progressively rolled out, while key product value chains will be addressed as a matter of priority. Further measures will be put in place to reduce waste and ensure that the EU has a well-functioning internal market for high quality secondary raw materials. The capacity of the EU to take responsibility for its waste will be also strengthened. Europe will not achieve transformative change by acting alone. The EU will continue to lead the way to a circular economy at the global level and use its influence, expertise and financial resources to implement the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. This plan aims also at ensuring that the circular economy works for people, regions and cities, fully contributes to climate neutrality and harnesses the potential of research, innovation and digitalisation. It foresees the further development of a sound monitoring framework contributing to measuring well-being beyond GDP.", "law or strategy": "Preparatory Instruments"}

It was proposed as a novel way to regulate the 17 most polluting industrial sectors in India. crep introduced -- after consultations with industry representatives -- tougher pollution standards, compliance to which were kept voluntary. Units which did not comply with existing regulations would have to submit bank guarantees to state pollution control boards (spcbs).   Subsequently, the Central Pollution Control Board (cpcb) set up task forces to monitor industries' compliance, and these, on March 3, 2005, submitted their 'report cards' to the steering committee in charge of crep's implementation.   Some sectors have complied with crep norms: refineries, for instance. But others, like the dye and dye intermediate sector, and thermal power plants, have slipped badly. spcb s have been extremely poor in collecting bank guarantees is also extremely poor; only the West Bengal spcb has forced polluters to pay up for not complying.   2 years after CREP It's time to take stock. Some crep norms are absurdly lenient. For instance, cement plants located in critically polluted or urban areas have to meet particulate emission levels of 100 mg/Nm3. Even green-field projects in the cement industry have to meet emission levels of just 50 mg/Nm3 (Normal cubic metre). But compare this with the achievable emission levels of 5-25 mg/Nm3 from various operations.  Some norms are unscientific, designed in such a way that they are not indicative of the true polluting potential of the industries. A good example of this is the Adsorbable Organic Halides limit for the pulp and paper industry. The norms were set up after consultations between industry representatives and cpcb. Is this why they are so weak?   The greatest weakness is that compliance to norms are voluntary, not legally binding. Most of the norms are, in any case, way below global best practices. And since they were mutually agreed upon, there is no excuse for industry to not meet them. As the task forces have reported, if many industries are not complying even with the current weak norms, then is not the charter incapable of attaining its goal, namely, steering industry to become responsible and improve its environmental performance?   Another weak area is the monitoring mechanism. Since the norms are not legally binding, it is extremely difficult for task forces to collect information and verify its credibility. They remain dependent on the industries for this, and so face an impossible task. For instance, the response from the dye and dye intermediate sector was very poor. Ultimately, the Gujarat Pollution Control Board had to issue public notices in newspapers to force units to disclose information. Till date, the task force for this sector has not been able to collect information on all units.   When crep was set up, it was presented as an alternate model to the traditional command and control regulatory mechanism. Two years down the line, it looks toothless.", "law or strategy": "Steering Instruments"}

In the context of Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), the CEDAW (1979), and the Beijing Platform of Action (1995), Bangladesh developed number of policies and sectoral strategies to ensure gender equality, which include; n The National Policy for Women\u2019s Advancement (NPWA) within the framework of CEDAW and a follow up of Beijing Conference on Women; n The National Action Plan (NAP) as a follow-up to the Beijing Platform of Action; n Enactment of a number of laws as well as National Policies. Besides, the major strategy documents of the government of Bangladesh-the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), The Sixth Five-Year Plan (2011-2015), Steps towards Change: NSARP-II, Vision 2021 specifically identifies bringing women into mainstream development activities of the Government as a major goal to be achieved. Being the primary victim of climate change impacts, women can play a central role in adaptation to climate change. Women also could play a key role in mitigating climate change by optimizing energy efficiency, using low-footprint energy sources and\u2019 techniques, and influencing a household\u2019s and community\u2019s consumption patterns. Therefore, when it comes to decision-making and implementation towards building resilient communities in the face of climate change, the full and meaningful participation of women become essential. The government of Bangladesh considered gender perspective to its strategies and action plan on climate change. National Adaptation Programme of Action (NAPA) has incorporated gender in a more comprehensive manner throughout the document, while BCCSAP (Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan 2009) emphasizes addressing the needs of the poor and vulnerable, including women and children, in all the activities under the Action Plan.

During oil production, the associated natural gas is often flared (burned) when economic, regulatory or technical barriers to the development of gas markets and gas infrastructure prevent it from being used or when re-injecting the associated gas back into the reservoir is not possible.  GGFR helps identify solutions to the array of technical and regulatory barriers to flaring reduction. To achieve this, we develop country-specific flaring reduction programs, conduct research, share best practices, raise awareness, secure global commitments to end routine flaring, and advance flare measurements and reporting.  GGFR advocates for ending routine gas flaring by garnering commitments for the Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative (ZRF). Governments and companies that endorse ZRF commit to no routine flaring in any new oil field developments and to end routine flaring at existing (legacy) oil production sites as soon as possible and no later than 2030.   Ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity is an integral part of GGFR\u2019s strategy. Natural gas resources help countries move toward a more sustainable energy path, and flaring wastes a valuable energy resource that could be used to advance the development of producing countries. For example, if this amount of gas were used for power generation, it could provide about 750 billion kWh of electricity, or more than the African continent\u2019s current annual electricity consumption.

Obligated parties include electricity retailers, electricity generators that supply customers directly, and customers who purchase electricity directly from the wholesale National Electricity Market. Electricity retailers are responsible for acquiring gas savings.  This is a white certificate scheme with tradeable energy savings certificates. Obligated parties and other businesses may apply to become \"Accredited Certificate Providers\" to deliver approved energy efficiency activities under the scheme.  In 2019, the NSW Government announced the scheme will be extended until 2050, with energy savings targets increasing over time to reach 13% by 2030. The obligation programme is also set to be renamed the \"Energy Security Safeguard\". In 2019 and 2020 the NSW Government is also consulting on a peak demand scheme to be developed based on, and alongside the Energy Savings Scheme.  Following a scheme review finalised in 2015, the obligation included a target of 7% annual electricity and gas purchases by retailers, increasing each year to reach 8.5% in 2019, which was to remain steady until 2025.  Calculation of energy savings are based on The Energy Savings Scheme Rule, which includes a combination of deemed energy savings measures, and measurement and verfication based methods.  The scheme administrator conducts audits of energy savings certificates (and thereby projects) across each Accredited Certificate Provider's portfolio, based on their agreed audit regime (which is normally based on an audit trigger at an agreed certificate creation threshold, e.g. every 50,000 certificates).

Since public procurement accounted for approximately 19.9% of the EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP), encouraging the use of \u201cgreen\u201d criteria in public procurement is a very important way to stimulate markets to produce and sell greener products. 1Accordingly, the Europe 2020 strategy mentions the need to encourage \u201cwider use of green public procurement\u201d within the context of the flagship initiative on a \u201cResource-efficient Europe\u201d . At the same time, stimulating GPP might also mean contributing significantly to smart growth by encouraging the development of environmental and climatefriendly technologies.  2 EU institutions have emphasized the importance of GPP since 2001, when the Commission adopted an Interpretative Communication on the \u201cCommunity law applicable to public procurement and the possibilities for integrating environmental considerations into public procurement\u201d (COM(2001) 274), which was the first to explain how environmental concerns may be taken into account at each separate stage of the contract award process in public procurement. Later on, in 2004, the Council and the European Parliament adopted two directives on public procurement 3containing specific reference to the possibility of including environmental considerations as specific provisions on the inclusion of environmental requirements in technical specifications (Article 23(3)b); the use of eco-labels (Article 23(6)); setting social and environmental conditions for the performance of contracts (Article 26); requiring economic operators to demonstrate they have met their environmental obligations (Article 27); requiring economic operators to demonstrate they can perform a contract in accordance with environmental management measures (Articles 48(2)f and 50); and applying award criteria based on environmental characteristics (Article 53). Following the 2008 Communication \u201cPublic Procurement for a Better Environment\u201d which accompanied the Sustainable Consumption and Production and Sustainable Industrial Policy Action Plan, the European Commission has developed common GPP criteria for a number of product and service groups, inviting authorities to include these criteria into their tendering procedures and thus to purchase greener products, works and services. These common criteria should also lead to a more harmonised use of green criteria in procurement procedures throughout the EU. More specifically, the Commission initially identified 10 product and service groups, and proposed a first set of \u201ccore\u201d criteria to foster GPP uptake by procuring authorities. The ten selected product groups are: cleaning products and services; construction; electricity; catering services and food products; gardening services and products; office IT equipment; copying and graphic paper; textiles; transport; and furniture.", "law or strategy": "Steering Instruments"}

The law requires that environmental assessment studies be conducted at the feasibility stage for all projects with potential adverse impacts on the environment, per the specified principles and standards.Any person supervising a project or facility whose operations have potential negative impacts on the environment must develop management plans to prevent or mitigate risks of these impacts and must acquire the means capable of implementing such strategies.Furthermore, the Act stipulates that authorities must incorporate environmental considerations in the process of planning for development projects, programs and developmental plans for various sectors and the general developmental plan.The law requires facility owners to keep the gases or fumes emitted from any form of fuel-burning within the allowed limits. They must also take the necessary steps to prevent the leakage or emission of air pollutants, except within the limits of acceptable environmental standards. These Regulations implement the Environmental Act No. 193 of 2001. These standards apply to all facilities in the Kingdom, existing and newly designed, public, and private, except for facilities exempted explicitly by the Presidency of Meteorology and Environment. A facility means any installation or activity expected to be a source of pollution or environmental deterioration. Under this regulation, the Presidency of Meteorology and Environment, an agency of the Ministry of Defence, is charged with the general supervision of environmental affairs in Saudi Arabia.These regulations aim at setting forth the procedures, ground and basis for regulating all actions having an impact on the environment, in addition to the coordination of response operations, pollution control, protection of natural resources and programs for related investment funds. It includes the types of environmental violations and appropriate penalties for protecting human health from pollution both at present and in the future.With respect to air pollution, the regulation does not include limits on emissions of methane, but it does apply limitations that may indirectly affect emissions from oil and gas facilities. Specifically, the regulation sets limits on all smoke, gases, or vapours and solid or liquid residue resulting from the burning of fuels for industrial purposes. The regulation also establishes air pollution source standards for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that apply to certain oil and gas facilities. For example, it requires that large-capacity storage vessels be equipped with vapour emission control systems to control VOCs.Furthermore, fugitive emissions of VOCs from petroleum and petrochemical processes shall be limited through the utilisation of good maintenance and inspection procedures as well as monitoring of potential VOC emission points.The regulations require violators to remedy any damage and submit a report showing the steps to prevent recurrence of violations. The regulation also establishes penalties and fines for breach of the environmental standards and prescribes enforcement procedures, including inspections and monitoring by specialised personnel; use of automatic detection for monitoring; notification of violations; use of international and regional reporting frameworks; and observation using satellites and remote sensing devices.", "law or strategy": "Law/Act"}

This includes $3.4 million to improve the energy efficiency of both new and existing homes, and $7.1 million to improve the energy efficiency of commercial buildings.     Building energy effiicency provides one of the least cost abatement options to support Australia's emissions reduction efforts, delivering up to 30 million tonnes in emissions reductions by 2030.  New funding will support the implementation of the Council of Australian Governments Energy Council's Trajectory for Low Energy Buildings, which is a roadmap to deliver a range of energy efficient improvements for both new and existing buildings. The Australian Government will develop best practice information, training and tools that help the transition to low energy homes, including through updates to the Your Home resource (yourhome.gov.au) and the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (nathers.gov.au).      New funding will include the expansion of the National Australian Built Environment Energy Ratings System (NABERS) (nabers.gov.au) and consider the expansion of the Commercial Building Disclosure (CBD) program (cbd.gov.au) following the current review of the program.      The CBD program requires owners to advertise the NABERS office energy rating of an office building greater than 1000 square metres when it is offered for lease or sale. Funding will support NABERS to expand its voluntary energy rating tools to include more building types, such as schools, retail stores and industrial buildings. The new NABERS online tool will reduce the cost of ratings through streamlining processes and automatic energy data collection. Disclosing the energy efficiency of a building provides potential owners or tenants with consistent and meaningful information about a building\u2019s performance, making it easier for them to make an informed decision.        The CBD program was reviewed in 2015 and found to be effective at motivating owners of poorly performing office buildings to improve the energy efficiency of those buildings, delivering $44 million in net benefits in its first four years.  The current review is considering whether to expand mandatory disclosure of energy performance to other high energy using classes of commercial building, such as hotels, data centres, office tenancies and shopping centres.  The Australian Government will also develop new information, online tools and case studies for industry on how to upgrade building performance, saving owners and tenants energy and reducing their energy bills.

{"Policy": "Energy Labelling of Larger Buildings (Eco-scheme)", "Policy_Content": "The energy labelling of buildings in Denmark was developed in the context of a long history of energy saving policy initiatives. Energy labelling was and is still seen as an important way to achieve energy savings in buildings - both existing and new - since the potential for energy savings in these areas is considered quite large. The annual supervision of larger buildings (more than 1 500 square metres) is carried out by between 500 and 700 specially trained consultants. About 25 000 buildings are concerned. Every month all buildings, except industrial buildings, and those with very low energy consumption, with a surface of more than 1 500 square metres must register their consumption of heat, electricity and water. Once a year, a consultant makes an audit comprising an Energy Label and an Energy Plan. The Energy Label evaluates the consumption of heat, electricity and water on scales from A to M (A is best) in comparison with average figures for comparable buildings. The Energy Plan informs the building owner about relevant measures for energy saving in the short and long run. This programme replaces the VKO programme (statutory heat inspection of larger heat furnaces) in operation since 1981. The new programme was evaluated in 2000 and the major conclusions were that the programme works very well for those who participate in it, but around half of the buildings still do not fulfil the requirements. Lack of awareness of the existence of the programmes contributed to non-participation. The energy savings in the buildings following the programme are larger than in those outside the scheme. Furthermore, the investments in energy savings are more focused in buildings participating in the programme and those responsible for energy are more aware of the results of investments.

They grew out of the Energy Intensive Business Grants and Improve programmes, both of which had  been superseded. The Commercial Buildings Audit Programmes have now been subsumed into 'EECA Business Programme'. Under the Commercial Buildings Audit Programmes, part-funding (up to 40%) was provided for energy efficiency projects in commercial buildings where there was a genuine financial barrier preventing the project occurring.Projects were delivered through contracted service providers, sourced by way of a RFP process.   Electricity savings are guaranteed (90%) with repayment mechanisms in place for any shortfalls. Although most providers focused on multiple project types & technologies, some focused exclusively on one type (e.g. lighting, continuous commissioning, monitoring & targeting). The commercial programme delivered annual savings of around 0.5 PJ a year; at a cost to Government of around 25% of the cost of building new supply assets.   Courses were in place to improve electricity management and efficiency in the commercial building services industry  -targeting energy specialists, facilities managers and commercial property valuers. Courses were delivered by the Energy Management Association New Zealand (EMANZ) which is an industry association of energy management experts including energy auditors, energy managers and suppliers of energy efficiency products and services. In May 2013, EECA Business in collaboration with the New Zealand Green Building Council (NZGBC), launched a new scheme to measure and rate the energy performance of commercial buildings in New Zealand.

The need to transpose Directive 2010/31/EU, amending the Directive 2002/91/EC, and the demand laid down in Royal Decree 1027/2007 of 20 July approving the Regulation on Building Heating Installations, on undertaking a periodical revision of energy efficiency requirements at intervals no longer than five years made it necessary to modify the RITE through the Royal Decree 238/2013, of 5 April.  UPDATE 2021: The RITE update will contribute to achieving the goal of improving energy efficiency by reducing primary energy consumption by 39.5% by 2030. The new standard requires that buildings with high consumption take the first step to become smart buildings that contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.", "law or strategy": "Regulation/Directive/Decision"}

It is also possible to break down the evolution of the bill according to the three factors below:  The rise in the bill is therefore due to that of net imports and above all to that of international fossil fuel prices:- sharp rise in crude oil prices (+30.4% for dated Brent, at $38.7/bl) and the price of imported gas (+13.5%, denominated in dollars), with gas following the evolution of crude oil 5 months behind;- and +36.9% for all imported solid mineral fuels ( in dollars). The import balance in quantities increased by +7.5%, under the effect of the following factors:- slight increase in final consumption (+0.4% in Mtoe, including non-energy);- less mild climate this year (index of 0.98 against 0.94 in 2003), which increases the final consumption of fossil fuels and that of peak electricity (requiring greater use of thermal power stations); - sharp drop in the extraction of fossil fuels , mainly coal: the closure of the La Houve mine in April 2004 marked the final cessation of coal mining in France.

{"Policy": "Public/Private Working Group to Address Energy Efficient Services Italy (2006)", "Policy_Content": "Experience over the past 30 years in the UK and North America has demonstrated that PPPs can be used to yield energy savings in the public sector; the main features of EE PPPs are similar to those of accommodation PPPs. They use Energy Performance Contracts (\u201cEPCs\u201d) and the private partners in these arrangements are known as Energy Service Companies (\u201cESCOs\u201d). ESCOs can also be set up by public entities.  There are different types of EPCs; including projects in which the private partner has the responsibility for delivering a service (i.e. providing final users with heat and/or electricity) through the construction and operation of a corresponding facility. The public entity repays the cost of the service.  The energy performance contracting (EPC) is a market-oriented mechanism for delivering energy efficiency projects. It is a contractual arrangement between an ESCO and its client, which involves an energy efficiency intervention on the client's facilities, whose performance is somehow guaranteed by the ESCO (Taylor et al., 2007). Under the EPC, the ESCO implements a project to deliver energy efficiency and repay the project\u2019s costs, including the investment costs, by using the stream of income from the cost savings. EPC means a \u201ccontractual arrangement between the beneficiary and the provider of an energy efficiency improvement measure, verified and monitored during the whole term of the contract, where investments (work, supply or service) in that measure are paid for in relation to a contractually agreed level of energy efficiency improvement or other agreed energy performance criterion, such as financial savings\u201d. The approach relies on the transfer of technical risks from the client to the ESCO on the basis of performance guarantees provided by the ESCO. In EPC, the remuneration for the ESCO is generally based on demonstrated performance, namely the level of energy savings or energy service which is reached.", "law or strategy": "Preparatory Instruments"}

In addition, powers have been given to municipalities to develop district heating and cooling systems (art 194).<br>&nbsp;The adoption of the law is expected to create more than 75,000 new jobs in the housing sector through retro-fitting the ageing housing stock (which currently consumes about 50% of France's energy).<br>&nbsp;The law sets minimum energy consumption requirements for public buildings and, where possible, requires them to be energy positive. Minimum energy requirements applicable to social housing are extended from collective dwellings to individual housing (art 13). Energy upgrades or integration of renewable energy sources can also be mandated through local plans (art 8-I). Government support for energy upgrades is maintained (art 14-II and art 22) and the installation of smart meters is mandated by law (conditions apply - art 27) Administrative procedure for energy upgrades of communal parts of buildings is simplified, by recognizing simple majority voting among tenants (art 14-I). Similarly, procedures for building certification are simplified by allowing for certification at delivery of the new built (art 15). Individual billing for heating and electricity consumption are required in all buildings fitted with a collective heating and/or hot water system (art 26).<br><br>&nbsp;The law also contains a package of measures to tackle air pollution through a clean transport programme, which incentivises citizens to buy low-emission vehicles by installing approximately 7 million charging stations and dedicated parking places. The law also requires the State to prioritise electric and low-carbon vehicles in procurement (at least 50% of new procurement). Taxi and rental companies will also have to reach a minimum of 10% of low-carbon vehicles in their vehicle park. A subsidy for replacing old diesel vehicles by new ones is also provided, with a dedicated capped budget. In addition, metropolitan areas are allowed to reduce traffic speed on all or part of the city routes (art 47) and introduce temporary traffic bans against polluting vehicles across the city (art 49). Additional measures include: price reductions for access to public transport in case of traffic ban for certain type of vehicles (art 48); penalties for removing particulate filters (art 58); and optimal urban planning of the transport system contributing to reduction of air pollutants (art 66).<br><br>&nbsp;The law sets a requirement for investors to declare the environmental impact of their investment portfolios, including specific reference to impact on climate change. Article 173 imposes listed companies to disclose financial risks related to the effects of climate change and measures adopted by the company to reduce them; banks and credit providers shall disclose the risks evidenced by the stress-tests that are regularly implemented in their mandatory risk reports; and institutional investors must disclose information to beneficiaries on how their investment decision-making process takes social, environmental and governance criteria into consideration (including climate risk), and the means implemented to contribute to the financing of the ecological and energy transition. Several other educational and financial assistance projects are to be commissioned to assist citizens with energy efficient retrofits, renewable sources installation and others.<br><br>&nbsp;The law also promotes waste reduction and resources savings, in particular a gradual decoupling between France's growth and consumption of raw materials.

The Obligation is planned to last for 25 years. A proposal was opened for discussion by interested Parties in 2000, the outcome of which was released in March 2001. A Statutory Consultation, including a draft Order was issued in August. The application date has been postponed several times from the original April 2001 and is currently planned for April 2002 in order to provide OFGEM with enough time to finalise operational details in relation to inconsistencies between English and Scottish versions of the order. These delays are causing difficulties for renewable energy producers who are not covered under the NFFO anymore and are obliged to trade in the open market. Scotland is expected to issue a similar proposal in the short term. All licensed electricity suppliers in England and Wales will be subject to the obligation; large-scale hydro and energy from waste will be excluded from the RO even if they count for the achievement of the 10% target. Suppliers will demonstrate their compliance with the obligation through RO Certificates. Their will be limited \"banking\" and even more limited \"borrowing\" of obligations.

Any entity that has a contract for purchasing electricity can be a producer of electricity from renewable energy sources, covering solar, wind, hydro, cogeneration, biomass, and fuel cells using hydrogen from renewable energy microproduction. Licensing is conducted through the internet, via the System of Registration of Microproducers (SRM), an electronic platform through with producers register their installations. Micro producers cannot inject more than 50 % of the power mentioned in the purchasing contract, limited to 3.68 kW, except in the case of installations for condominiums. There are two types of feed-in tariffs: General Regime - The tariff is equal to the cost of electricity sold under the purchasing contract Bonified Tariff - a special reference tariff is defined during the first 5 years following the installation. The reference tariff for the first 10 MW installed is defined as EUR 650/MWh and decreases 5 % for each additional 10 MW registered in the SRM. The reference tariff applies differently depending on the renewable energy technology used. It is 100% for solar (i.e., the full EUR 650/MWh), 70% for wind, 30% for hydro, cogeneration and biomass. For fuel cells, the tariff is the one that applies to the renewable energy source used for hydrogen production.

The Danish Council on Climate Change is an independent body of experts which exists because Denmark and the rest of the EU have a political objective to reduce CO2 emissions by 80-95% by 2050. The Danish Council on Climate Change advises on how Denmark can most effectively and cost-effectively undertake the transition to a low-carbon economy by 2050. That is to say a resource-efficient society with an energy supply based on renewable energy with markedly lower greenhouse gas emissions from other sectors.  The Danish Council on Climate Change contributes with solid, professional recommendations based on independent analyses which have as their foundation the overall objective for 2050. To achieve this goal it is necessary to look at ways of reducing greenhouse gas emissions throughout society over the next 35 years. In this regard it is important to set targets which identify ways forward. Therefore, the Danish Council on Climate Change investigates what the best solutions are for Denmark in the short, medium and long term in relation to Denmark's security of supply, competitiveness and opportunities for continued growth and development for the benefit of citizens\u2019 welfare.  The Danish Council on Climate Change was established as a result of the Climate Change Act, which outlined the Council's tasks. In this Climate Change Act it is stated that the Danish Council on Climate Change must:  evaluate the status of Denmark's implementation of national climate objectives and international climate commitments, analyse potential means of transitioning to a low-carbon society by 2050 and identify possible measures to achieve greenhouse gas reductions, draw up recommendations to help shape climate policy, including a selection of potential mechanisms and transition scenarios, contribute to the public debate. The Danish Council on Climate Change must, to the extent required in the preparation of its analyses and other work, consult and involve relevant parties, including, among other business interests, social partners in the labour market and civil society.  The Danish Council on Climate Change wishes to have a close interaction with the international community, and so currently an essential part of the Council's work is in dialoguing with stakeholders on climate change - not only to stay abreast of the latest factual knowledge about developments in the field of technologies and climate analysis, for example, but also to hear stakeholder opinions and proposals on how progress towards a low-carbon society can be organised.

{"Policy": "Energy efficiency and Demand Side Management (EEDSM) Programme", "Policy_Content": "Residential energy-savings programmes Eskom\u2019s solar water-heating programme offers a rebate to customers who use solar power instead of electricity to heat water. Customers can either replace existing electric geysers with solarheated systems or they can install low-pressure solar water-heating systems to replace water heating via other electrical appliances. The past financial year has seen a significant increase in the number of both high- and low-pressure solar water-heating system installations. 158 175 claims (27 149 high-pressure systems and 131 026 low-pressure systems) were submitted to energy audits for measurement and verification. 7 870 units not verified this financial year will be verified in 2012/13. The Residential Mass Rollout Programme was implemented in the 2011/12 financial year to complement the ongoing CFL project, which has largely exhausted its power-savings potential. The solution is based on a free rollout of a \u201cbasket\u201d of technologies, focusing on optimising single customer visits. These measures resulted in demand savings of 36MW for the year under review. The residential market is seen as a key focus area to obtain savings in order to manage the supply/demand situation in the immediate future. Eskom\u2019s Power Alert and Geyser evening campaigns between 17:00 and 21:00 aim to reduce power demand during the evening peak. Commercial and industrial incentive programmes The Integrated Demand Management business unit has implemented a number of alternative incentive programmes that financially reward companies for achieving energy savings. The Standard Product is based on a catalogue of energy savings technologies offered to consumers. Each item/technology will be offered at a fixed financial rebate which is based on deemed future energy savings. This is an efficient and quick method, targeting smaller projects (<250kW) mainly in the commercial market. The Standard Offer will allow mainly commercial and industrial consumers to implement energy savings technologies based on their specific needs. Eskom will measure actual savings over a three year period, effectively \u201cbuying\u201d energy savings at a predetermined rate per technology group. Eskom aims to significantly reduce current project approval timelines, allowing quick turnaround of savings opportunities. These programmes have streamlined the incentive-programme application process, resulting in greater participation by the commercial and light industrial sector, which in the past had limited participation in integrated demand management programmes. In 2011/12, 18 projects were submitted through the Standard Offer programme, realising demand savings of 8MW, and 215 projects were submitted through the Standard Product programme realising demand savings of 3MW. Power buybacks As part of the efforts to create the necessary space to perform essential and critical generation plant maintenance, Eskom has entered into power buyback agreements with some of its large industrial customers. The power buyback period is typically for 30 days or longer with all current agreements terminating by 31 May 2012. The requirement is that customers reduce their base load demand and this reduction is purchased by Eskom at a rate negotiated with customers. The rate takes into account the customers\u2019 fixed costs, contractual obligations and various other requirements including the requirement of no permanent job losses. This initiative has proved to be beneficial in creating the additional space on the power system through base load demand reduction. During this power buyback period, lower than usual commodity prices and surplus stock levels would have had a significant negative impact on the economy, jobs and customers\u2019 business operations. Eskom believes that through the power buyback scheme, customers are in a slightly more favourable position than they would have otherwise been in creating a win-win situation for both parties. Energy-efficiency marketing Eskom embarked on a major drive aimed at reducing electricity consumption among all electricity users. Two major initiatives, comprising nine programmes, aim to promote immediate and longterm behavioural changes. The immediate-response initiative aims to avoid load shedding through the Power Alert and 5pm-to-9pm evening programmes. Eskom\u2019s 49M campaign is a long-term behavioural-change initiative that seeks to embed energy-efficiency attitudes and practices in all consumers, particularly residential users, with the ultimate goal of reducing their consumption by 10%. The integrated demand management business unit provides advice and financial assistance to residential customers and corporations to \u201cmake the switch\u201d and install energy-efficient technologies for a sustainable lifestyle. Internal energy efficiency Eskom\u2019s aim is to improve the energy efficiency of its facilities (power plants and buildings) through the undertaking of energy audits and efficiency programmes focusing on lighting, heating, ventilation and air-conditioning (HVAC).

{"Policy": "Voluntary carbon budgets on company level", "Policy_Content": "Company-level carbon budgets were introduced in the National Climate Change Response Policy as a mechanism to translate South Africa\u2019s mitigation commitments into emission targets for sub-sectors and companies. A carbon budget is defined in the Carbon Budget Design Document as (DEA, 2015): \u2026 a greenhouse gas (GHG) emission allowance, against which direct emissions arising from the operations of a company, during a defined time period will be accounted. The term \u201ccarbon\u201d in carbon budget is shorthand for carbon dioxide, and further, for all GHGs accounted for in the latest South African inventory (2010). The first phase of carbon budgets in South Africa (2016\u20132020) is being implemented as a voluntary pilot to allow companies and the DEA the opportunity to prepare for a second mandatory phase (to commence in 2021). Phase 1 does not include compliance measures, and the most important element of this phase is considered to be enhanced reporting requirements. The decision to start with a voluntary phase was influenced by variability in company-level emissions data, a lack of experience in allocating carbon budgets, and the desire to build sufficient capacity in both the DEA and companies to successfully implement a carbon budget system before such a system is made mandatory. Carbon budgets were allocated to a selection of companies in the form of a cumulative maximum emission allowance for the five-year carbon budget period. The Carbon Budget Design Document states that while five years is a sufficiently long period of time to allow companies the flexibility to take into account f luctuations in market conditions and output while planning to meet their carbon budgets, it is also short enough to allow the DEA to respond to developments in local and international conditions (DEA, 2015). The companies which were approached to participate in Phase 1 Carbon Budgets were selected from a set of target sectors containing entities emitting more than 100 000 tonnes of GHG per annum, or producing the \u201csame primary product\u201d as a company within this category. Companies which did not meet these criteria, but still wished to participate, could voluntarily enter into negotiations with the DEA to be allocated carbon budgets. Phase 1 Carbon Budgets included the following design features: \u2022 carbon budgets were allocated to companies to support both current operations and existing expansion plans; \u2022 there was no consideration of any national or sectoral mitigation targets when carbon budgets were set; \u2022 companies are expected to report annually on their progress in terms of meeting their carbon budgets, and report at the end of Phase 1 on whether they have remained within their carbon budgets \u2013 but there will be no legal consequences if companies exceed their carbon budgets; \u2022 companies are not expected to undertake any additional mitigation actions not already planned when carbon budgets were allocated; \u2022 no transfer of unused portions of carbon budgets from the first to subsequent phases will be allowed; \u2022 no transfer of portions of their carbon budgets between companies will be allowed during Phase 1 (although trading will be considered in subsequent phases); \u2022 only emissions from a company\u2019s own operations (Scope 1 emissions) will be included in carbon budgets (but the possibility of creating a mechanism for dealing with Scope 2 emissions during subsequent carbon budget phases will be considered); and \u2022 while the DEA intends to use the experience gained by implementing the first phase of carbon budgets to design the second and subsequent phases, all Phase 1 design elements will be reevaluated when the next phase of carbon budgets is designed, and new elements may also be included in the next phase \u2013 the current design should thus be viewed as only indicative of the design of the second and subsequent phases of carbon budgets. While there is no legal requirement for companies to remain within their carbon budgets, there are legal requirements requiring reporting of mitigation actions. The draft Pollution Prevention Plan Regulations issued in terms of the National Environmental Management: Air Quality Act (Act 39 of 2004) (Republic of South Africa, 2016) legally require companies to: \u2022 describe interventions that will be implemented to reduce GHG emissions over the course of the next five years, and the expected mitigation impact that these actions will have, in a pollution prevention plan to be approved by the Minister of Environmental Affairs; and \u2022 to submit annual progress reports that outline the mitigation actions that were implemented within the last year, and if relevant, details of any deviations from the approved pollution prevention plan and remedial action to address deviations. The list of target sectors for carbon budgets is as follows: \u2022 coal mining; \u2022 production and/or refining of crude oil; \u2022 production and/or processing of natural gas; \u2022 production of liquid fuels from coal or gas; \u2022 cement production; \u2022 glass production; \u2022 ammonia production; \u2022 nitric acid production; \u2022 carbon black; \u2022 iron and steel production; \u2022 ferro-alloys production; \u2022 aluminium production; excluding foundries \u2022 polymers production; and \u2022 pulp and paper production. Furthermore, the Carbon Budget Design Document states that \u201cany company which produces electricity via the combustion of fossil fuels, for public or private consumption, excluding the use of backup generators, will also be allocated a carbon budget\u201d (DEA, 2015). The identification of companies to participate in Phase 1 of Carbon Budgets was complicated by a misalignment of the draft PPP regulations, the Carbon Budget Design Document, and the draft National Greenhouse Gas Emission Reporting regulations (DEA, 2015; Republic of South Africa, 2016; Republic of South Africa, 2016b). While the PPP regulations stipulate the \u201cprimary activity\u201d to be of interest, the Carbon Budget Design Document stipulates that the \u201cprimary product\u201d is of interest. There is a disconnect between the use of \u201cproduct\u201d and \u201cactivity\u201d, and even problems using the term \u201cprimary\u201d without any guidance on the distinction between primary and secondary activities and/ or products. Further, the mandatory reporting regulations stipulate that only activities which have emissions exceeding thresholds must be reported on, whereas PPPs and Carbon Budgets require reporting of all emissions.", "law or strategy": "Steering Instruments"}

{"Policy": "Easy Ways to Save Energy Campaign United States of America (2005)", "Policy_Content": "In October 2005, U.S. Department of Energy Secretary Bodman launched his Easy Ways to Save Energy campaign with a promise to provide energy assessments to 200 of the largest U.S. manufacturing plants. DOE's Industrial Technologies Program (ITP) responded to the Secretary's campaign with its Save Energy Now initiative, featuring a new and highly cost-effective form of energy savings assessment. The approach for these assessments drew heavily on the existing resources of ITP's technology delivery component. Over the years, ITP Technology Delivery has worked with industry partners to assemble a suite of respected software tools, proven assessment protocols, training curricula, certified energy experts, and strong partnerships for deployment. The Save Energy Now assessments conducted in calendar year 2006 focused on natural gas savings and targeted many of the nation's largest manufacturing plants - those that consume at least 1 TBtu of energy annually. The 2006 Save Energy Now assessments focused primarily on assessments of steam and process heating systems, which account for an estimated 74% of all natural gas use by U.S. manufacturing plants. Because of the success of the Save Energy Now assessments conducted in 2006 and 2007, the program was expanded and enhanced in two major ways in 2008: (1) a new goal was set to perform at least 260 assessments; and (2) the assessment focus was expanded to include pumping, compressed air, and fan systems in addition to steam and process heating. DOE ITP also has developed software tools to assess energy efficiency improvement opportunities in pumping, compressed air, and fan systems. The Save Energy Now assessments integrate a strong training component designed to teach industrial plant personnel how to use DOE's opportunity assessment software tools. This approach has the advantages of promoting strong buy-in of plant personnel for the assessment and its outcomes and preparing them better to independently replicate the assessment process at the company's other facilities. Another important element of the Save Energy Now assessment process is the follow-up process used to identify how many of the recommended savings opportunities from individual assessments have been implemented in the industrial plants. Plant personnel involved with the Save Energy Now assessments are contacted 6 months, 12 months, and 24 months after individual assessments are completed to determine implementation results. A total of 260 Save Energy Now assessments were successfully completed in calendar year 2008. This means that a total of 718 assessments were completed in 2006, 2007, and 2008. As of July 2009, we have received a total of 239 summary reports from the ESAs that were conducted in year 2008. Hence, at the time that this report was prepared, 680 final assessment reports were completed (200 from year 2006, 241 from year 2007, and 239 from year 2008). The total identified potential cost savings from these 680 assessments is 1.1 billion per year, including natural gas savings of about 98 TBtu per year. These results, if fully implemented, could reduce CO2 emissions by about 8.9 million metrictons annually. When this report was prepared, data on implementation of recommended energy and costsavings measures from 488 Save Energy Now assessments were available. For these 488 plants,measures saving a total of 147 million per year have been implemented, measures that will save $169 million per year are in the process of being implemented, and plants are planning implementation of measures that will save another $239 million per year. The implemented recommendations are already achieving total CO{sub 2} reductions of about 1.8 million metric tons per year. This report provides a summary of the key results for the Save Energy Now assessments completed in 2008; details of the 6-month, 12-month, and 24-month implementation results obtained to date; and an evaluation of these implementation results.

{"Policy": "IGCB Green Homes Rating System India (2009)", "Policy_Content": "The housing sector in India is growing at a rapid pace and contributing immensely to the growth of the economy. This augurs well for the country and now there is an imminent need to introduce green concepts and techniques in this sector, which can aid growth in a sustainable manner. Green concepts and techniques in the residential sector can help address national issues like water conservation, energy efficiency, fossil fuel usage reduction in commuting, handling of consumer waste and conserving natural resources. Most importantly, these concepts can enhance occupant health, happiness and well-being. By 2030, the country is expected to have 68 cities with a population of more than one million, 13 cities with more than 4 million people and 6 megacities with populations of 10 million or more, with Mumbai and Delhi among the biggest cities worldwide. (Source: Ministry of Urban development).This implies that the country would see an upsurge in housing requirements for all strata of communities. Alongside this comes the demand for energy and water. The residential sector consumes about 24% of the electrical energy generated, which would continue to rise. The housing sector in the country needs to make judicious shifts towards sustainable living so as to live a better earth for posterity. As on date, India has almost 15 lakh dwelling units going green under IGBC Green Homes Rating System. Against this background, the Indian Green Building Council (IGBC) has launched \u2018IGBC Green Homes Rating System\u2019 to address National priorities. By applying IGBC Green Homes criteria, homes which are sustainable over the life cycle of the building can be constructed. This rating programme is a tool which enables the designer to apply green concepts and criteria, so as to reduce environmental impact, that are measurable. The programme covers methodologies to cover diverse climatic zones and changing lifestyles. IGBC Green Homes is the first rating programme developed in India, exclusively for the residential sector. It is based on accepted energy and environmental principles and strikes a balance between known established practices and emerging concepts. The system is designed to be comprehensive in scope, yet simple in operation. IGBC has set up the Green Homes Core Committee to develop the rating programme. This committee comprised of key stakeholders including architects, builders, consultants, developers, home owners, academicians, institutions, manufacturers and industry representatives. The committee, with a diverse background and knowledge has enriched the rating system both in its content and process.", "law or strategy": "Steering Instruments"}

In addition:*the rule required a 95% reduction of all emissions, including methane, from wet seal centrifugal compressors, requiring owners/operators to capture excess emissions and route them to a process or flare. *the rule added methane standards for reciprocating compressors and required those newly triggering the requirement to replace the rod packing after 26,000 hours of operation or every 36 months.*the rule added methane standards for pneumatic controllers and required those newly triggering the requirements to be replaced with low-bleed alternatives.*pneumatic pumps at natural gas processing plants had to be limited to zero methane and VOC emissions; pumps upstream needed to meet a 95% methane and VOC reduction target (with some exceptions where flare capacity was not available).The rule required semi-annual leak detection and repair inspections at well sites (targeting methane and VOCs), and quarterly inspections at compressor stations, with repairs to be made within 30 days of a detected leak of at least 500 ppm. Finally, the rule included reporting and recordkeeping requirements.The rule did not cover liquids unloading, for lack of information. NOTE: The Trump Administration proposed amendments to these regulations in August 2020 that would have removed sources in the transmission and storage segment from the source category; rescinded the requirements to reduce volatile organic compounds (VOC) and methane emissions from these sources; and separately rescinded the methane-specific requirements applicable to sources in the production and processing segments. However, the 2020 rule was disapproved by a joint resolution of Congress under the Congressional Review Act, which was signed on 30 June 2021.

This credit applies to energy efficiency improvements in the building envelope of existing homes and for the purchase of high-efficiency heating, cooling and water-heating equipment. Efficiency improvements or equipment must serve a dwelling in the United States that is owned and used by the taxpayer as a primary residence. The maximum tax credit for all improvements made in 2011 - 2016 is $500. The cap includes tax credits for any improvements made in any previous year. If a taxpayer claimed $500 or more of these tax credits in any previous year, any purchases made in 2011 - 2017 will be ineligible for a tax credit.  Building Envelope Improvements  Owners of existing homes may receive a tax credit worth 10% of the cost of upgrading the efficiency of the building's envelope. Installation (labor) costs are not included and the credit is capped at $500 for all improvements. To be eligible for the credit, the improvement must meet the prescriptive requirements established for it under the 2009 International Energy Conservation Code (including supplements).

Systems must have a thermal efficiency rating of at least 75 percent to qualify: $300  Background  The Energy Policy Act of 2005 established the tax credit for energy improvements to existing homes. The credit was originally limited to purchases made in 2006 and 2007, with an aggregate cap of $500 for all qualifying purchases made in these two years combined. There were also separate individual caps for the different equipment types. The Energy Improvement and Extension Act of 2008 (H.R. 1424: Div. B, Sec. 302) of 2008 reinstated the credit for 2009 purchases and made other minor adjustments. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 further extended the credit to include improvements made in 2010 and replaced the $500 aggregate cap with a $1,500 aggregate cap for improvements made in 2009 and 2010. This credit has since been renewed several times, but the credit was reduced to its original form and original cap of $500.  Geothermal heat pumps were originally eligible for this credit, with a $300 cap. The federal Energy Policy Act of 2005 established tax credits of up to $2,000 for builders of all new energy-efficient homes, including manufactured homes constructed in accordance with the Federal Manufactured Homes Construction and Safety Standards. Initially scheduled to expire at the end of 2007, the tax credit was extended several times. Site-built homes qualify for a $2,000 credit if they are certified to reduce heating and cooling energy consumption by 50% relative to the International Energy Conservation Code (IECC) 2006 and meet minimum efficiency standards established by the Department of Energy. Building envelope component improvements must account for at least one-fifth of the reduction in energy consumption.  Manufactured homes qualify for a $2,000 credit if they conform to Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards and meet the energy savings requirements of site-built homes described above. Manufactured homes qualify for a $1,000 credit if they conform to Federal Manufactured Home Construction and Safety Standards and reduce energy consumption by 30% relative to IECC 2006. In this case, building envelope component improvements must account for at least one-third of the reduction in energy consumption. Alternatively, manufactured homes can also qualify for a $1,000 credit if they meet ENERGY STAR Labeled Home requirements.  Certification The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has issued guidance to provide information about the certification process that a builder must complete to qualify for the credit. The guidance also provides for a public list of software programs that may be used in calculating energy consumption for purposes of obtaining a certification.

Combined with a minimum university and industry cost share of 20%, up to USD 17.4 million will be invested in these projects. The project aims for selected universities to leverage fundamental understanding of materials and PV devices to help industry partners advance manufacturing processes and products. These projects have the potential to significantly reduce the cost of electricity produced by PV from current levels of USD 0.18-USD 0.23 per Kilowatt hour (kWh) to USD 0.05 - USD 0.10 per kWh by 2015 - a price that is competitive in markets nationwide. Each university will work closely with an industry partner for projects to retain a commercialisation focus and so that results are quickly transitioned into market ready-products and manufacturing processes. Additionally, students will be exposed to diverse PV-related commercialisation efforts, enhancing workforce development in an effort to increase competitiveness and retain qualified scientists in the growing domestic PV research and development industry.
