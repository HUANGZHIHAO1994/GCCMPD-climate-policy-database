{"Policy": "Ozone-depleting Substances and Halocarbon Alternatives Regulations Canada (1999)", "Policy_Content": " \"Last amended in 2016. This regulation was introduced under the Environmental Protection Act (1999) and, among other, requires permit and a the payment of a fee for HFCs imports and exports. The Regulations Amending the Ozone-depleting Substances and Halocarbon Alternatives Regulations (Amendments) establish a phase-down of HFC consumption (manufacture plus import minus export) from an established baseline. The phase down begins in 2019 with a 10% reduction in consumption with further reduction steps in 2024, 2029 and 2034 in order to achieve an 85 percent reduction in HFC consumption by 2036.\" The Regulations Amending the Ozone-depleting Substances and Halocarbon Alternatives Regulations (amendments) aim to reduce the supply of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) that enter into Canada and the demand for HFCs in manufactured products, thereby averting future HFC releases to the environment. This will reduce Canadian GHG emissions, in order to help limit increases in global average temperatures and contribute to Canada\u2019s international obligations to combat climate change.  The amendments will ensure Canada is able to meet its obligations established under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol on Substances that Deplete the Ozone Layer (Montreal Protocol). The Kigali Amendment is an amendment to the Montreal Protocol, adopted by the Parties to the Montreal Protocol on 15 October 2016 in Kigali, Rwanda. The Kigali Amendment adds hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), powerful greenhouse gases introduced to replace ozone-depleting substances, to the list of controlled substances under the Protocol.   The Regulations Amending the Ozone-depleting Substances and Halocarbon Alternatives Regulations (amendments) establish a phase-down of HFC consumption (manufacture plus import minus export) from an established baseline. The phase down begins in 2019 with a 10% reduction in consumption with further reduction steps in 2024, 2029 and 2034 in order to achieve an 85 percent reduction in HFC consumption by 2036. The amendments also introduce prohibitions, by specific dates, on the manufacture and import of certain products and equipment that contain, or are designed to contain, HFCs and HFC blends, with a global warming potential (GWP) above a specific limit.  The Regulations Amending the Ozone-depleting Substances and Halocarbon Regulations (mendments) apply to companies manufacturing, importing, exporting, using and selling HFCs alone or in a blend, and to companies manufacturing, importing, and exporting products containing or that are designed to contain HFCs.  Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) are substances used in refrigeration and air conditioning systems, as foam blowing agents, and as aerosol propellants.  The Amendments apply to the refrigeration and air conditioning, foam, mobile air-conditioning, and aerosols sectors.  Please note that the controls on HFCs in place under the current Ozone-depleting Substances and Halocarbon Alternatives Regulations (that is: requirement to obtain written authorizations for certain activities and to report on those activities) will continue with the coming into force of the amendments.   The Regulations Amending the Ozone-depleting Substances and Halocarbon Alternatives Regulations (amendments) published in Part II of the Canada Gazette on October 18, 2017, will come into force on April 18, 2018.  The amendments establish a phase-down of HFC consumption from an established baseline.

{"Policy": "Emissions Reduction Fund", "Policy_Content": "The Emissions Reduction Fund (ERF) is a voluntary scheme that aims to provide incentives for a range of organisations and individuals to adopt new practices and technologies to reduce their emissions.   The Fund operates via an auction mechanism. Once or twice a year, the government holds auctions for achieving a set level of emissions abatement. Project proponents bid at the auctions to achieve part of the abatement target via emissions reduction projects, with the lowest cost projects selected by the government.  Eligible projects must meet certain criteria and be aligned with one of several \"methods\" of carbon abatement from the following list of options:  a generic method for emissions reductions at facilities reporting under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Scheme (NGERS) capture and destruction of coal mine fugitive emissions reduction of oil and gas fugitive emissions reductions in emissions-intensity of transport commercial, industrial and aggregated energy efficiency capture and combustion of landfill gas and agricultural waste alternative treatment of organic waste capture and combustion of biogas from wastewater, and methods for the land sector, including increasing soil carbon, reducing livestock emissions, expanding opportunities for environmental and carbon sink plantings, and reforestation. Participants can earn Australian carbon credit units (ACCUs) for emissions reductions. One ACCU is earned for each tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2-e) stored or avoided by a project. ACCUs can be sold to generate income, either to the government through a carbon abatement contract, or in the secondary market. ERF Projects are required to undergo third-party auditing, the applicable standards for which are published on the Clean Energy Regulator website.  To ensure that ACCUs are \"additional\" (that is, the emissions reductions would not have happened without the programme), a so-called \"safeguard mechanism\" has been established. Data from NGERS is used to establish baseline levels of emissions for industrial facilities, and project proponents must ensure projects are additional to established baselines.  The ERF is administered by the Clean Energy Regulator and enacted through the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Act 2011, the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Regulations 2011 and the Carbon Credits (Carbon Farming Initiative) Rule 2015.

{"Policy": "Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy", "Policy_Content": "In 2009, when Government first set the national energy efficiency target of 20% by 2020, it decided that the public sector should provide leadership on energy efficiency for the whole of our economy and society.   This is why the public service was assigned a more challenging target of 33% energy efficiency improvement.   The policy context for this is outlined in Chapter 2 of the Public Sector Energy Efficiency Strategy. The Strategy sets out a clear policy direction for public sector action on climate action through energy efficiency and sustainable energy management whilst contributing to public sector reform.   Outlined in the Strategy are new actions to complement the existing suite of support and regulatory measures for public sector energy efficiency already in place since 2009.   The Strategy identifies where most potential exists for further energy efficiency gains across the public sector in areas such as the built environment, public lighting, transport and water services (Chapter 3).   It also outlines the technical guidance, financial supports and governance structures which will assist public sector bodies to further understand their energy use, identify cost effective energy efficiency projects and develop robust project business cases to allow the establishment of a strong project pipeline and coordinated government decision making on investment. To assist public bodies and provide oversight of the implementation of the Strategy, a Steering Group will be established chaired by DCCAE and consisting of officials from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community & Local Government (DHPCLG), Department of Transport, Tourism & Sport (DTTAS), the OPW, the SEAI and the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA). The Strategy recognises that simply identifying actions is not enough. Taking action requires leadership and accountability from senior managers akin to what is already required in areas such as performance management and governance. That is the rationale for the establishment of a new Governance structure (Chapter 4). While each public body must take responsibility for managing its own energy, its parent Department will have an oversight and leadership role for ensuring that the bodies under their aegis, i.e. their  \"group\", engage in structured energy management. This will have a number of advantages:  Creating accountability, as Departments will have to report to government annually;  Forming a coherent view of energy saving potential across all 350 public bodies;  Allowing more flexibility in strategic decisions to be made on where best to concentrate effort within a Department  'group ' -not all bodies will be able to make 33% energy savings, but some will be able to do better than 33%. As part of the governance structure, each public sector body is required to designate a senior manager (anticipated to be Assistant Secretary level in Government departments) with decision making powers on finance, personnel and facilities, as Energy Performance Officers (EPO 's).

{"Policy": "Strengthen the management capacity of the energy sector (Policy no. 6, Maldives National Energy Policy and Strategy 2010)", "Policy_Content": "Background:  The existing legal framework requires improvement to cater to the evolving energy sector particularly with respect to meeting goals set out for renewable energy technologies, energy efficiency and energy conservation. Specific regulation for governing areas such as independent power generation, and the pricing and the use of renewable energy technologies are currectly not in place. Therefore, formulation of a Maldives Energy Act, a Maldives Hydrocarbon Exporation Act, Maldives Energy Standards and incorporation of energy efficiency and conservation measures into the national building code is critical.Likewise, institutions in the energy sector are weak in terms of technical capacity to effectively deliver technical and regulatory functions for a vibrant energy sector. Hence, it is important that the regulatory and policy making institutions are developed with defined roles and responsibilities and the technical capabilities to perform their functions. Strategies: 1. Improve the capacity of the ministry that is mandated for the energy sector in a sustainable manner ensuring continutiy of capacity development to strengthen the ministry in developing integrated long-term energy plans and conducting policy analysis for the energy sector.2. Improve the capacity within the utility companies to enhance and expand their contribution to energy supply development.  3. Develop and manage a national energy data base.4. Develop management capabilities of the energy sector institutions through appropriate training, empowerment and proper delegation of authority. Major Aim:  To strengthen the institutional and legal framework of the energy sectorAchievement: Establishment of a separate ministry and regulatory authority for the energy sector. Also a dedicated energy department was formed under the ministry in 2012. Progress has been made in the sector since the formation of these two institutions to implement the policies and to regulate the sector. Stakeholders:  The lead agency for the energy secor is the Ministry of Environment and Energy (MEE). There is a separate regulatory body called the Maldives Energy Authority (MEA). MEE and MEA needs to develop local capacity to manage the energy sector effectively and to keep abreast with technological developments and good governance practices.

The subsidy in 2006 was CNY 1373 per MT of fuel ethanol produced. Starting in 2002, most fuel ethanol produced was grain-based. However, a moratorium on such ethanol plants was imposed as of December 2006 by the NDRC and Ministry of Finance, lasting for a year and a half.   The government's policy was to substitute non-grain ethanol for grain ethanol, and not to compete with food requirements.   The China National Cereals, Oils and Foodstuffs Corporation (COFCO), is one of the main companies that handles manufacturing and production in the Chinese ethanol industry.   Timeline:   1993: COFCO set up its first ethanol plant in Heilongjiang province with annual capacity of 30 000 tonnes and enlarged to 280 000 tonnes per annum. 2007: China's first commercialized non-grain based ethanol project plant merged and reconstructed another ethanol plant in Anhui province with a capacity of 320 000 tonnes per annum. A third plant, in Guangxi province, began trial operations in December 2007 and was designed to produce 200 000 tonnes of ethanol per annum using only cassava as its feedstock.  23 July 2010: COFCO founded National Biofuel Research and Development Center in order to accelerate the cellulosic ethanol industrialisation.

{"Policy": "Energy Strategy 2050", "Policy_Content": "Energy Strategy 2050: The ES2050 aims at further boosting renewable energies in order to reach the following indicative electricity generation targets: 4400 GWh (excluding hydro) by 2020, 11400 GWh (excluding hydro) by 2035; 37400 GWh average yearly hydro production by 2035. The main levers are a - time-limited \u2013 funding increase (by increasing the grid surcharge cap for electricity) and increased CO2 levy proceeds (which are partly allocated - with cantonal co-funding - for heating from renewable sources in buildings).  Keeping overall renewable funding under control has been an important policy goal since the introduction of a feed-in tariff[1] in 2009 (and also in earlier policies). This has been achieved by capping the grid surcharge (albeit increasing it in successive steps from 0.45 cent/kWh in 2012 to 0.6 cent in 2014, 1.1 cent in 2015, 1.3 cent in 2016, 1.5 cent in 2017).  A new element of the ES2050 are sunset clauses for the different measures: end 2022 for the hydropower market premium and new commitment of feed-in premiums, end 2025 for the Building Refurbishment Programme (and its renewable heating component), end 2030 for investment aid. On 4 September 2013 the Federal Council submitted to Parliament the first set of measures in the Energy Strategy 2050. The Council wishes to significantly develop the existing potential for energy efficiency and exploit the potential of hydro power and the new renewable energies (sun, wind, geothermal, biomass). The remaining 5 nuclear reactors remain in operation as long as they are technically safe. The Federal Council stated explictly, that no new reactors should be built in Switzerland and proposed a legal prohibition to build new reactors in Switzerland. The set of measures entails a total revision of the Energy Law as well as changes in various other Federal laws. Parliament approved the law proposal on 30 September 2016, Swiss voters followed suit on 21 May 2017. The first set of measures in Energy Strategy 2050 aims at increasing energy efficiency and promoting the development of renewable energies. Most of the measures planned by the Federal Council require enacting changes to the law in Parliament. In the course of the consultations on this subject Parliament has rejected certain of these measures, which will, therefore, no longer be mentioned below. However, other measures have been introduced by Parliament. Building Refurbishment Programme: Additional funding will be added to the Building Programme, which started in 2010. The programme subsidises the cost of the energy-saving building renovations and is partially financed by revenues from the CO2 levy on fuels with the rest financed by the Swiss Cantons (=26 federal states). Tax incentives for building renovation: With the implementation of new Energy Act, it will be possible to deduct the costs of a building demolition from federal and cantonal income taxation to make way for a new building. Together with the costs of energy-related improvements, demolition costs can be deducted also in the next two tax periods if it is not possible to fully offset the expenditure in the year in which it was carried out. Emissions standards for vehicles: The Energy Strategy 2050 provides for a tightening up of the current emissions specifications for vehicles. As a consequence, the accepted limit for CO2/km emissions for all new passenger vehicles on the road will be reduced to an average of 95 g CO2/km by the end of 2020. New standards will also be extended to new Light Commercial Vehicles (LCV), which will be limited to an average of 147 g CO2/km by the end of 2020. Both measures have been taken in accordance with EU law. Due to the lack of vehicle producers in Switzerland the importers are the obligated parties. Competitive tenders: Programmes and projects which contribute towards more economical electricity consumption in industry, the services sector and households are supported by competitive tenders. The promotional subsidies are awarded by auction. In this way projects and programmes with the best cost-benefit ratio get a chance to participate. The financing is covered by the electric grid surcharge that electricity consumers pay to promote renewable energies and energy efficiency. These promotional subsidies for competitive tenders are available until the year 2030 at the latest.", "law or strategy": "Law/Act", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": "Energy systems;Buildings;Industry;Multi-sector;Transport", "subsector": "Transport:Road;Energy systems:Electricity & heat", "Instrument": "Information Programmes;Government Provision of Public Goods or Services;Regulatory Approaches;Subsidies", "Sector-Instrument": "Regulatory Approaches:Efficiency or environmental performance standards;Regulatory Approaches:Energy efficiency standards for equipment;Regulatory Approaches:Mandates for energy retailers to assist customers invest in energy efficiency;Regulatory Approaches:Fuel economy performance standards", "objective": "Economic", "subobjective": "Economic:Productivity/competitiveness", "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "National"}

{"Policy": "Building Energy Certification", "Policy_Content": "The requirement for certification of buildings in the EU Directive on the energy performance of buildings was partly transposed in January 2007 by Royal Decree 47/2007, outlining the procedure for the energy certification of new buildings. The Royal Decree established a register of technical documents recognised for the energy certification of buildings, according to requirements outlined by the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Housing. Building on the procedure in the Royal Decree, Regional Governments will develop specific procedures, as well as register certificates and undertake inspections. The computer application for the previous energy certification of buildings programme was updated acording to the Royal Decree 47/2007 and is available free of charge in the web site of the Ministry of Industry, Tourism and Trade.  The demands in terms of energy certification for buildings, stemmed from Directive 2002/91/EC of the European Parliament and the Council, of 16 December 2002, were further amended by Directive 2010/31/EU of the European Parliament and the Council, of 19 May 2010, relating to energy efficiency in buildings. This made it necessary to transpose anew the new amendments introduced into the Spanish legal system through the Royal Decree 235/2013, thanks to which, the Directive 2010/31/EU is partially transposed in terms of the energy certification of buildings by consolidating Royal Decree 47/2007 with the inclusion of the basic procedure to certify energy efficiency in existing buildings, and also taking into account the experience of its applications in the last five years. The Royal Decree 235/2013 sets out the obligation of having a certificate of energy efficiency available to buyers or users of buildings. The said certificate shall include objective information on the energy efficiency of the building and reference values such as energy efficiency minimum requirements; in this way, the energy efficiency of the building or of a unit of it can be compared and assessed by either owners or tenants.

{"Policy": "Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation", "Policy_Content": "The Non-Fossil Fuel Obligation (NFFO) was the governments previous major instrument for encouraging growth within the renewable energy industry.  The institutional framework was established as part of the  1989 Electricity Act . The NFFO in England and Wales and similar obligations in Scotland and Northern Ireland required electricity supply companies to secure specified amounts of new generating capacity from non-fossil sources, including renewables. The NFFO process began with the governments announcement of proposals for an order covering specific technology bands. Five orders were carried out during the programmes span. The Non-Fossil Purchasing Agency (NFPA), an agent through which the electricity suppliers contracted collectively with renewable generators, issued bids for prospective schemes for specific technologies. Renewable energy generators competed in a tender process. Each scheme that passed a \"will-secure\" test submitted a final bid and the government then selected the cheapest schemes to secure the required capacity within each technology band. The renewables capacity was secured through contracts with generators at premium prices. The guaranteed contractual price was made up of the pool price and a technology-specific premium. Additional costs incurred by the electricity suppliers under these contracts were financed through the Non-Fossil Fuel Levy. It was funded by all final electricity consumers as a levy on electricity consumption. The levy is also used to support nuclear power. The levy rate was set by the regulatory body each year, and in 2003 stood at 0.3% of the cost of fossil-fuel sources of electricity.", "law or strategy": "Decisional Guidelines, Codes and Frameworks", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": "Energy systems", "subsector": "Energy systems:Electricity & heat", "Instrument": NaN, "Sector-Instrument": NaN, "objective": NaN, "subobjective": NaN, "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "National"}
{"Policy": "Continuous, Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) Program United States of America (2008)", "Policy_Content": "The Continuous Lower Energy, Emissions and Noise (CLEEN) Program is the FAA's principal environmental effort to accelerate the development of new aircraft and engine technologies that will reduce noise, emissions, and fuel burn. Through the CLEEN Program, the FAA partners with the aviation industry via a cost-sharing approach to enable the industry to expedite integration of these environmentally beneficial technologies into current and future aircraft. Technologies developed by the CLEEN Program will result in a fleet of aircraft that produce less noise, fewer emissions, and use less fuel.  These technologies support the overall environmental performance goals of the FAA\u2019s Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) to achieve environmental protection that allows sustained aviation growth. Through the public-private partnership of the CLEEN Program, the FAA and industry are working together to develop technologies that will enable manufacturers to create aircraft and engines with less noise, fewer emissions, and improved fuel efficiency. The technologies being accelerated by the CLEEN Program have relatively large technological risk but also enhanced benefits. Government resources help mitigate this risk and incentivize aviation manufacturers to invest in and develop these high reward technologies which might otherwise not be pursued. By cost-sharing the development with the FAA, industry is willing to accept the greater risk and can better support a business case for these technological developments. Once these risks are addressed and the technology is matured via the CLEEN Program, the companies apply these technologies to their future aircraft and engine products, leading to noise, fuel burn, and emissions benefits throughout the fleet for years to come. In addition to these benefits, the CLEEN Program has resulted in better analysis and design tools that improve the aircraft or engine products produced by these companies, well beyond the benefits provided by individual technology applications.  The CLEEN Program is implemented in five-year phases, and has goals for noise, fuel burn, and emissions. In 2010 the FAA initiated the first phase, entering into five-year agreements with Boeing, General Electric (GE), Honeywell, Pratt & Whitney (P&W), and Rolls-Royce.    In those five years, technologies were matured and demonstrated in major ground and flight test demonstrations, paving the way for introduction in future aircraft. Since then, a number of these technologies have successfully transitioned into new aircraft and engines that are flying today.  Based on the success of this program, the second phase of CLEEN was initiated in 2015 for a five-year term. Under the CLEEN Phase II program, FAA awarded five-year agreements to Aurora Flight Sciences, Boeing, Collins Aerospace, America's Phenix/Delta TechOps/MDS Coating Technologies, General Electric, Honeywell, Pratt & Whitney, and Rolls-Royce.   To receive funding from CLEEN, industry partners need to match or exceed the funds provided by the FAA. Through the first two phases of CLEEN, industry has contributed $388 million of cost share to the CLEEN Program, which has exceeded the FAA contribution of $225 million.  Following subsequent successes under the second phase, the third phase of the CLEEN Program was launched in 2021 and is planned to run through 2026.   Program Goals All three phases of the CLEEN Program have targeted reductions in aviation noise, emissions, and fuel burn.   The CLEEN Phase I and II Program goals include developing and demonstrating:  Certifiable aircraft technology that reduces aircraft fuel burn, and/or supports the FAA's goal to achieve a net reduction in climate impacts from aviation; Certifiable engine technology that reduces landing and takeoff cycle (LTO) nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions below International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) Committee for Aviation Environmental Protection (CAEP) standards, and/or reduces absolute NOx production over the aircraft's mission; Certifiable aircraft technology that reduces noise levels, relative to the Stage 4/5 standards and/or reduces the noise contour area in absolute terms; and \"Drop-in\" sustainable aviation fuels, including quantification of benefits. Drop-in fuels will require no modifications to aircraft or fuel supply infrastructure. As industry meets the program's goals, the FAA has made the goals for successive phases of the program increasingly more stringent. Further, additional goals have also been added over time. In addition to the above goals, CLEEN Phase III goals include developing and demonstrating certifiable aircraft technology that:  Reduces community noise exposure; Reduces non-volatile particulate matter emissions relative to the CAEP/11 standard; and Reduces noise levels during the LTO cycle for civil supersonic airplanes and/or reduces absolute NOx emissions for civil supersonic airplanes over the aircraft's mission.

They grew out of the Energy Intensive Business Grants and Improve programmes, both of which had  been superseded. The Commercial Buildings Audit Programmes have now been subsumed into 'EECA Business Programme'. Under the Commercial Buildings Audit Programmes, part-funding (up to 40%) was provided for energy efficiency projects in commercial buildings where there was a genuine financial barrier preventing the project occurring.Projects were delivered through contracted service providers, sourced by way of a RFP process.   Electricity savings are guaranteed (90%) with repayment mechanisms in place for any shortfalls. Although most providers focused on multiple project types & technologies, some focused exclusively on one type (e.g. lighting, continuous commissioning, monitoring & targeting). The commercial programme delivered annual savings of around 0.5 PJ a year; at a cost to Government of around 25% of the cost of building new supply assets.   Courses were in place to improve electricity management and efficiency in the commercial building services industry  -targeting energy specialists, facilities managers and commercial property valuers. Courses were delivered by the Energy Management Association New Zealand (EMANZ) which is an industry association of energy management experts including energy auditors, energy managers and suppliers of energy efficiency products and services. In May 2013, EECA Business in collaboration with the New Zealand Green Building Council (NZGBC), launched a new scheme to measure and rate the energy performance of commercial buildings in New Zealand. The New Zealand scheme, NABERSNZ \u201e\u00a2, is based on the successful National Australian Built Environment Rating System (NABERS) and has been adapted for New Zealand conditions. NABERSNZ \u201e\u00a2 is a voluntary scheme that aims to assist owners and tenants to reduce energy use and costs, and reduce greenhouse emissions. Under NABERSNZ \u201e\u00a2 qualified assessors measure and score the energy performance of office buildings, giving tenants and owners a star rating out of 6.

{"Policy": "Performance Standards and 5-Star Rating for Buildings: MEPS and NatHERs", "Policy_Content": "From 1 May 2006, the Building Code Australia (BCA) has included energy efficiency provisions for all building classifications. Australia revised the BCA to account for energy efficiency as part of its strategic reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. To complement passage of the housing provisions, Australian governments agreed to implement a consistent Nation-wide House Energy Rating Scheme (NatHERS) to enable householders to assess the energy efficiency of houses and make more informed choices about housing purchases and renovation. For housing: Energy efficiency provisions for detached and semi-detached dwellings were introduced on 1 January 2003. From 1 May 2006, the provisions were increased to a nominal 5 star NatHERS rating. Since the BCA is a performance based Code, builders and designers have the option of meeting these standards in one of two ways: by following the prescriptive deemed-to-satisfy provisions; or by achieving the required house energy rating using an accredited software tool. The Australian Capital Territory Government also required disclosure of the NatHERS rating during the sale or lease of each house.  For residential buildings other than houses:   The development of BCA energy efficiency provisions for commercial buildings has proceeded in two stages: BCA class 2 to 4 buildings and BCA class 5 to 9 buildings. Provisions for Class 2, 3 and 4 buildings (i.e. apartments, hotels) ware developed for inclusion in the BCA on 1 May 2005. Provisions for Class 5 to 9 buildings (offices, retail, carparks, manufacturing/processing and public buildings) were developed for inclusion in the BCA on 1 May 2006. Minimum Energy Performance Standards for office, retail, carparks, manufacturing/processing and public buildings (Building Code of Australia classes 5-9) Class 5 to 9 buildings include office, retail, carparks, manufacturing/processing and public buildings, a programme for incorporating minimum energy performance standards into the BCA has been underway since 2004. Following public consulation on draft regulations, the Australian Building Code Board decided in November 2005 to include energy efficiency provisions for Class 5 to 9 buildings in BCA 2006. As announced by the federal and territorial governments, all new residential buildings would meet a five star energy rating from May 2006. The Australian Capital Territory Government also required disclosure of the NatHERS rating during the sale or lease of each house. In April 2009 the Council of Australian Government requested the ABCB deliver through the Building Code of Australia (BCA) the following: (i) a six star energy rating, or equivalent, for new residential buildings; and (ii) a significant increase in the energy efficiency requirements for all new commercial buildings. These measures were successfully incorporated into BCA 2010 and also included national provisions for water heaters and lighting in new homes.

{"Policy": "Five-Year Plan for Developing Environmentally-Friendly Agriculture Republic of Korea (2001)", "Policy_Content": "Reduction in N2O emissions from nitrogenous fertilizers in farms has been achieved through eco-friendly agriculture reducing chemical fertilizers. The government of Korea has been promoting a Five-Year Plan for Developing Environmentally-Friendly Agriculture since 2001 in order to actively foster environment-friendly agriculture. Currently, the 3rd version of the five-year plan is being made. As an example of an eco-friendly project, in order to build a sustainable low-carbon resource-circulating agricultural system, eco-friendly agricultural complexes will be created on city and county levels, connecting the crop sector and livestock sector (greater than 600 ha). Also, eco-friendly agricultural districts greater than 10 ha will be created on town and village levels. An eco-friendly direct payment agricultural system, which provides subsidies per acre, is being promoted for developing eco-friendly farms. Additionally, a customized fertilizer support program has been created, which promotes the use of this fertilizer based on soil test results in order to reduce the use of chemical fertilizers. Through the implementation of eco-friendly projects, certified eco-friendly agricultural areas have increased by more than 60 percent each year since 2000. As a result, consumption of nitrogen fertilizers (per ha) has been reduced from 423,000 tons in 2000, to 354,000 tons in 2005, and to 242,000 tons in 2010. This consumption decreased by 42.8 percent in 2010 compared to usage in 2000, significantly contributing to N2O reductions. Since 2000, nationwide surveys have been implemented to assess N2O emissions, successfully establishing the basic measurement system. Controling the use of nitrogen fertilizer has expanded farming management leading to a reduction in N2O emissions. On the other hand, to implement Integrated Nutrient Management (INM) for eco-friendly agriculture, the information on proper handling of fertilizers and fertilization based on soil test has been provided. Also, research on N2O emissions in the upland and the development of reduction technology continue to be promoted. In addition, based on the research results from 2002 to 2010, in relation to field crops such as peppers, beans, and cabbage, a Manual Guide for Cultivation Technology will be published. This manual will promote low carbon agricultural skills such as organic trials, tillage management, water management, use of nitric acid suppressant, and improvement of cropping systems.", "law or strategy": "Preparatory Instruments", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": "AFOLU", "subsector": NaN, "Instrument": "Government Provision of Public Goods or Services", "Sector-Instrument": NaN, "objective": "Economic;Environmental", "subobjective": "Economic:Technological spillover/innovation;Environmental:Ecosystem impact", "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "National"}

{"Policy": "Differentiated levy on heavy duty traffic", "Policy_Content": "Heavy duty vehicles pay a levy per km which varies regarding EURO-emission standard. Electric and hydrogen HDV are exempted from the tax. The ultimate goal of the policy is to internalize all external cost of heavy duty transport transiting the Swiss alps and to incentivize the shift to train cargo.  The heavy-duty (> 3.5 tonnes) vehicle fee (HVF) was introduced in 2001. Its prime goal is to internalise external road transport costs. The HVF is calculated on distance, weight and emissions standards, replacing a previous flat fee. Its initial rate was CHF 0.017/tonne/km, rising to CHF 0.025/tonne/km as from 1.1.2005; it will level off at a maximum CHF 0.0275/tonne/km in 2008. Parallel to the rate increases, the maximum lorry weight was lifted to 34 tonnes in 2001 and to 40 tonnes in 2005. This gradual approach gave hauliers time to improve productivity, which partly offset the cost of the HVF. In the first four years since the introduction of the HVF road transport costs have increased by some 6%. Two-thirds of HVF revenues are allocated to construction of rail infrastructure (including two trans-Alpine railway tunnels) to support modal shift. Annual revenues ranged between CHF 800-900 million (EUR 515-580 million) in the first four years and rose to some CHF 1.3 billion (EUR 840 million) in 2005. The HVF resulted from protracted bilateral transport negotiations with the EU. Switzerland was concerned that the lifting of the then prevailing 28- tonne limit on lorries, as demanded by the EU, would unleash massive transit traffic and seriously jeopardize constitutionally mandated modal shift and sustainability policies. The introduction of the HVF was approved by a 57% majority of the Swiss people in 1998. The effects of the HVF (as well as higher truck load limitations) are compelling. Freight mileage decreased 8% in 2001-04 after decade-long uninterrupted growth, while transported freight volumes actually increased. There was virtually no traffic rerouting through neighbouring countries. Transit mileage through the Alps decreased 8%. The decline was the steepest in the first two years due to fleet modernisation and efficiency gains. Provisional data for 2005 indicates a -3% mileage decline because of the rate increase. Modelling indicates that by 2007 CO2 emissions from road freight transport will be 6-8% below what would have happened without the new regime with HVF and higher weight limit. The main effects on transit are expected when high-performance modal shift infrastructure will become operational. Long-term, road freight mileage growth will resume in Switzerland, because of overall European transport trends, albeit more moderately than in the past. However, the share of rail transport in Switzerland is expected to grow from currently 39% to 47% by 2030, thereby reversing past trends.  The current rates are 0.0031 CHF/tkm for Euro 3 trucks and below, 0.00269/tkm for Euro 4 and 5 trucks and 0.0026 CHF/tkm for Euro 6 trucks.", "law or strategy": "Decisional Guidelines, Codes and Frameworks", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": "Transport", "subsector": "Transport:Road;Transport:Rail", "Instrument": "Taxes;Government Provision of Public Goods or Services;Subsidies", "Sector-Instrument": "Taxes:Congestion charges, vehicle registration fees, road tolls;Government Provision of Public Goods or Services:Investment in transit and human powered transport", "objective": "Economic", "subobjective": "Economic:Productivity/competitiveness", "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "National"}

The ECO replaces two previous schemes, the Carbon Emissions Reduction Target (CERT) and the Community Energy Saving Programme (CESP). ECO places legal obligations on the larger energy suppliers to deliver energy efficiency measures to domestic energy users. It operates alongside the Green Deal (see separate entry), which is designed to help people make energy efficiency improvements to buildings by allowing them to pay the costs through their energy bills rather than upfront. The Green Deal and the ECO will help reduce carbon emissions from the UK's domestic building stock, which is an essential part of the UK's plan to meet its statutory domestic carbon emission reduction targets by 2050.The ECO is intended to work alongside the Green Deal to provide additional support in the domestic sector, with a particular focus on vulnerable consumer groups and hard-to-treat homes. Under the rules of ECO, energy suppliers are obliged to help improve the energy efficiency of their domestic customers' buildings in three distinct areas:1.

The source of SPP generation must be from: * non-conventional energy such as wind, solar and mini-hydro energy; * waste or by-products from agricultural and industrial activities; * co-generation using natural gas or petroleum products under a number of conditions. At the end of 1996, there were 17 SPP contracts, three firm and 14 non-firm, with a total installed capacity of 910 MW. About 370 MW was sold to the national grid. Regulations on power purchase provisions from Very Small Renewable Energy Power Producers (VSREPP) were approved in May 2002. They allow for net metering and a streamlined interconnection process to minimise VSREPP connecting costs.

The objective of European Technology Platforms (ETP) is to develop and implement a common vision for the development of a certain sector or technology area. This includes the drafting of a comprehensive long-term programme for research and technological development in the area of the technology platform. Where the Commission shares the view that an area has adequate potential and that a technology platform would provide European added value for the development of the sector concerned, the Commission supports the initiative. The European Biofuels Technology Platform was launched in 2006 and aims to overcome the technical and non-technical barriers to biofuel use. The BiofuelsTP is focused on aspects of research and development on renewable energy sources vital to achieve widespread use of liquid and gaseous biofuels within the next decade or so. It aims to help in the development of cost-competitive, world class biofuel technology, contribute to the creation of a European biofuels industry and to identify the research needs to achieve this. This includes the establishment of a public-private partnership serving the interests of all stakeholders and providing guidance on and promotion of relevant Research, Development and Demonstration (RD & D). The main contribution is the development of a Strategic Research Agenda and Strategy Deployment Document (SRA/SDD) identifying key RD & D working lines for the next decades, as necessary to achieve the goals outlined in the Biofuels Research Advisory Councils 2006 Vision Report. It also acts as a source of information and opinion on the development of biofuels for transport in the EU.

Thus, it is extremely important to utilize the efforts for climate change adaptation in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. Therefore, it is necessary to implement planned measures based on assessment of future impact.  Since the land of Japan extends from the subarctic zone in the north to the subtropical zone in the south, and various climate zones exist therein, the agriculture, forestry and fisheries practiced differ from region to region.

{"Policy": "Basic Environmental Law Japan (1993)", "Policy_Content": "Law No.91 of 1993. Effective on November 13, 1993 The Basic Environment Law aims to comprehensively and systematically promote policies for environmental conservation to ensure healthy and cultured living for both the present and future generations of the nation. It articulates basic principles, clarifying the responsibilities of the State, local governments, corporations and citizens, and prescribing the basic policy considerations for environmental conservation.   The Basic Environment Law was passed in the 128th session of the Diet unanimously on November 12th 1993, and put into force on 19th of the month. Replacing the previous basic law, the Basic Law forms the basis of the structure of Japanese environmental laws and policies in this globalized world. The Law declares the basic principles of environmental policy, defines the responsibilities of each actor in the society, and prescribes the policy instruments to protect the domestic and global environment.  Before the enactment of this Basic Law, Japanese environmental policies had been promoted based on two basic laws. One is the Basic Law for Environmental Pollution Control, enacted in 1967 to combat the serious industrial pollution which overrode Japan in the period of rapid economic growth in the late 1950's and 1960's. The other is the Nature Conservation Law, enacted in 1972 to stop the destruction of outstanding features of the natural environment. Although these laws made considerable success in tackling the environmental problems they addressed, they became more and more insufficient to deal with new problems such as global environmental problems, urban pollution by everyday life, loss of accessible natural environment in urban areas and degrading environmental protection capacity in forests and farmlands. The Basic Environment Law was enacted to address all these problems, replacing the Basic Law for Environmental Pollution Control. A part of the Nature Conservation Law was also replaced by the new Law.  The Law establishes three basic principles of environmental policy. These are as follows.  The blessings of the environment should be enjoyed by the present generation and succeeded to the future generation. A sustainable society should be created where environmental loads by human activities are minimized. Japan should contribute actively to global environmental conservation through international cooperation. Secondly, the Law defines the responsibilities of each actor in the society, i.e. central government, local governments, corporations and the people. These actors should make efforts to protect the environment through fair burden sharing, cooperating with each other.  Based on these principles and responsibilities, the Law stipulates the policy instruments of Japanese environmental policy. In addition to regulatory measures traditionally taken for pollution control and nature protection, the Law prescribes the following measures, among others.  Environmental consideration in policy formulation Establishment of the Basic Environment Plan which describes the directions of long-term environmental policy.

{"Policy": "Public Sector Buildings Programme", "Policy_Content": "The Green Paper on Sustainable Energy outlines the need to make significant energy savings in the public sector as part of the wider obligation to reduce Greenhouse Gas emissions. In that context the government decided in July 2001 to require all public sector Departments, agencies, non-commercial state bodies, health boards and local authorities with responsibility for new building construction or major refurbishment to use best practice in both materials and technology and to avail of opportunities being promoted by Sustainable Energy Ireland. In addition, all government departments and state bodies are required to report annually in their Annual Reports to Government and the Oireachtas (the two houses of Irish Parliament) on measures to reduce energy usage in buildings occupied by them. The programme consists of the following complementary schemes: - The Economic and Social Infrastructure Operational Programme within the framework of the National Development Plan 2000-2006 provides EUR 12.7 million for energy efficiency initiatives in public sector buildings. - The Design Study Support Scheme provides financial support of EUR 2.02 million to public sector bodies for the purposes of procuring external professional expertise to examine and report on the technical and economic feasibility of energy efficient design and technology solutions in new building and refurbishment projects. - The \"Model Solutions\" Investment Support Scheme provides investment assistance of EUR 9.08 million to selected projects undertaken by public sector organisations. - A scheme to provide financial support of EUR 1.6 million to energy management bureau operations to encourage the development of energy management service companies to provide off-site energy control and management for public sector buildings has been launched. The installation of a comprehensive Building Energy Management System is central to the success of the energy conservation programme for state buildings.

{"Policy": "Assessment and Review of the Climate Change Policy Program (Interim Report) Japan (2004)", "Policy_Content": "Last summer, contrary to the continuing low temperatures and shortage of sunlight in Japan, Europe experienced unusually high temperatures, resulting in heat stress-related deaths and forest fires. This year too, many countries around the world, including Japan, are faced with abnormal weather, such as heat waves and heavy rain. The increase in the occurrence of abnormal weather in recent years has led to the outbreak of forest fires on a large scale in Europe, Siberia, Asia, and the U.S.A. It has also seriously affected agriculture and stock farming. It is predicted that in the future, as global warming worsens, such kinds of abnormal weather will bring frequent and massive damages. The frequent occurrence of abnormal weather in recent years has already deepened the concerns of citizens about the effects of global warming. The Kyoto Protocol is the first step taken by the international community to work towards realizing the ultimate objective of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (hereinafter referred to as \u201cUNFCCC\u201d or \u201cConvention\u201d) that was adopted to tackle climate change-related problems. The Climate Change Policy Programme (hereinafter referred to as \u201cProgramme\u201d) was formulated in 1998 following the adoption of the Kyoto Protocol. It was revised in March 2002, prior to Japan\u2019s ratification of the Kyoto Protocol. In order to fulfill the 6% reduction commitment of the Kyoto Protocol in the first commitment period etween 2008 and 2012, while taking into consideration changes in the socio-economic situation and conditions related to the development and diffusion of technology, the Programme adopted a step-by-step approach. The first step refers to the three years between 2002 and 2004, the second step refers to the three years between 2005 and 2007, and the third step refers to the three years between 2008 and 2012 (the first commitment period of the Protocol). The Programme is scheduled for assessment and review in 2004 and also in 2007. As three years have passed since the Programme was last revised, 2004 is the year in which assessment and review will be carried out in order to pave the way for the second step of the Programme.  In January 2004, the Central Environment Council started deliberation of the assessment and review of the Programme. The Council has held twelve meetings to assess the progress of policies and measures implemented by each sectors; to conduct hearings of concerned ministries, agencies, and organizations; and to review policies and measures for each sector. Following the deliberations, the Central Environment Council put together an interim report to provide a basic direction for the assessment and review of the Programme. The Central Environment Council calls for the government to step up assessment and review of the Programme and utilize this interim report to make steady progress towards fulfillment of the 6% reduction commitment of the Kyoto Protocol. Global warming has tremendous deleterious effect on the earth\u2019s overall environment. Mankind staking its fate must make every effort to achieve the ultimate objective of UNFCCC by creating a socio-economic system that causes no global warming. In Japan, every social actor must not relegate this responsibility to others, but actively take the initiative to prevent global warming. Businesses, public entities, and citizens must treat global warming as their own problem and take actions to further implement various measures. To this end, all ministries and agencies of the government must work together, utilize all policy instruments, and appeal to all actors of the society to take concrete actions to prevent global warming.

It focuses on six key \u201cingredients&; businesses need to grow:     export markets;    innovation;    infrastructure;    skilled and safe workplaces;    natural resources; and    capital.      Each of these has its own programme of work.    More recently, the Business Growth Agenda has been informed by the Government\u2019s response to a report by the Green Growth Advisory Group. The Green Growth Advisory Group was established by the Government in January 2011 and was tasked with exploring how New Zealand can build a more productive and competitive economy, while also achieving high-quality environmental outcomes. The central conclusion of the report was that New Zealand needs a broad growth strategy where all sectors take into account their environmental performance rather than focusing on a select group of \u2018green\u2019 industries. Government agreed and in response recommendations contained in the report have been integrated into this wider Business Growth Agenda.    The Business Growth Agenda Progress Report 2013 shows the significant progress the Government has made across each of the six areas that are critical to business success and growth: Export Markets, Capital Markets, Innovation, Skilled and Safe Workplaces, Natural Resources and Infrastructure. In early 2014 the BGA developed a specific initiative - under 'natural resources' - to transition to a lower-emission economy using measures that both improve economic productivity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The BGA is looking to do this by introducing policies that overcome barriers to the grater uptake of, amongst other things, renewable fuels.    In the second half of 2016 \u2018Towards 2025\u2019 was published. It reports on the progress made in delivering on nearly 500 specific actions across the BGA and particularly the priority actions that were set out in 2014. It also sets out the future direction of the BGA, which in 2016 will focus on investing for growth. The BGA is prioritising key areas that are seen as particularly critical to further build business confidence and to provide platform for sustained growth into the future.

It reiterates the country's pledge, first made in 2009, to reduce emissions by 16% below 2020 business-as-usual levels if there is a legally-binding global agreement in which all countries implement their commitments in good faith. Ahead of this, Singapore has embarked on policies and measures that will reduce its emissions by 7% to 11% below 2020 BAU levels.<br />\n<br />\nThe strategy identifies accelerated coastal erosion, higher incidences of intense rain or prolonged drought, biodiversity impacts, and disruption to food and other supplies as potential climate change impacts facing Singapore. It reiterates the country's commitment to a multilateral approach to dealing with climate change, and argues that a global approach will be more conducive towards Singapore's long-term growth and development. It highlights Singapore's position on a global climate agreement as one that supports the UN model of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities.<br />\n<br />\nThe strategy outlines three key principles that guide Singapore's response to climate change:<br />\n- Long-term and integrated planning;<br />\n- Pragmatically and economically sound measures; and<br />\n- Developing innovative solutions for Singapore and global markets.<br />\n<br />\nIt also identifies four main approaches that Singapore will follow in addressing climate change:<br />\n- Reducing carbon emissions in all sectors;<br />\n- Being ready to adapt to the effects of climate change;<br />\n- Harnessing green growth opportunities; and<br />\n- Forging partnerships (e.g. with international and regional bodies).<br />\n<br />\nThe document contains chapters on the importance of climate change and Singapore's national circumstances and constraints, as well as detailed chapters on both mitigation and adaptation plans and policies.In terms of mitigation, energy efficiency is the country's core strategy (given the country's limited access to renewable energy opportunities). Specific identified strategies to reduce emissions across different sectors include:<br />\n- Power generation: switching fuel mix away from fuel oil to natural gas;<br />\n- Water: incinerate sludge rather than dispose in landfills;<br />\n- Households: extend minimum energy performance standards to lighting and other appliances;<br />\n- Buildings: require Green Mark certification for all new buildings;<br />\n- Transport: implement carbon emissions-based vehicle scheme to encourage purchase of low carbon emission cars; and<br />\n- Industry: develop and support energy efficiency financing pilot schemes.<br />\n<br />\nThe strategy identifies coastline protection, addressing flood risks, and managing water resources as the three key adaptation priorities of Singapore, and also focuses heavily on green growth as a development model.

Though this is a stronger target, it is not enough to reach 1.5\u00b0C, and a proposal between 58% and 70% is needed (European Parliament proposed 60%).

For instance, revise the Renewable Energy Directive based on new proposals from the \u2018Fit for 55%\u2019 package, and decrease the emissions cap of the EU-ETS, steering a coal phase-out and better performance for cars and the increase in the share of electrical vehicles.\n\u00a0", "law or strategy": "Regulation/Directive/Decision", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": "Multi-sector", "subsector": NaN, "Instrument": "Government Provision of Public Goods or Services", "Sector-Instrument": NaN, "objective": NaN, "subobjective": NaN, "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "International"}

The REFIT places an obligation on Eskom (South Africas public utility) to purchase the output from qualifying renewable energy generators at pre-determined prices based on the levelised cost of electricity. Eskoms Single Buyer Office has been appointed as the Renewable Energy Purchasing Agency (REPA), and is obliged to purchase power from licensed renewable energy generators. Licensed independent renewable energy power producers can also sell power directly to buyers outside of the REFIT mechanism. The cost of the tariff will be passed through to Eskom electricity customers.  On 26 March 2009, NERSA approved REFITs Phase I which covered the following four technologies: Wind; Small hydro; Landfill Gas Methane and Concentrated Solar (CSP), Plant Parabolic trough with storage (6 hrs per day).     For 2009 the REFIT are as follows: ZAR 1.25/kWh for wind; ZAR 0.94/kWh for small hydro (less than 10 MW); ZAR 0.90/kWh for landfill gas; ZAR 2.10/kWh for concentrating solar power (CSP).    On 2 November 2009, REFITS Phase II tariffs were approved for six new technologies:     Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) trough without storage (ZAR 3.14/kWh), CSP Tower with storage of 6 hrs per day (ZAR 2.31/kWh), Large-scale (1MW or more) grid connected PV systems (ZAR 3.94/kWh), solid biomass (ZAR 1.18/kWh) biogas (ZAR 0.96/kWh).    Fossil fuels can be included in the CSP technologies, but are limited to 15% of total primary energy input.  The REFIT power purchase agreement will last for 20 years, and the tariff can be adjusted yearly for inflation.  For the first five years of the REFIT, a full review of the scheme will take place yearly, following which it will take place every three years. Specific license conditions for renewable energy generators include reporting, monitoring and verification requirements, and termination conditions for non-compliance with production of renewable energy.  The REFIT scheme does not include off-grid power generation.  Specific license conditions for renewable energy generators include reporting, monitoring and verification requirements, and termination conditions for non-compliance with production of renewable energy.

Any entity that has a contract for purchasing electricity can be a producer of electricity from renewable energy sources, covering solar, wind, hydro, cogeneration, biomass, and fuel cells using hydrogen from renewable energy microproduction. Licensing is conducted through the internet, via the System of Registration of Microproducers (SRM), an electronic platform through with producers register their installations. Micro producers cannot inject more than 50 % of the power mentioned in the purchasing contract, limited to 3.68 kW, except in the case of installations for condominiums. There are two types of feed-in tariffs: General Regime - The tariff is equal to the cost of electricity sold under the purchasing contract Bonified Tariff - a special reference tariff is defined during the first 5 years following the installation. The reference tariff for the first 10 MW installed is defined as EUR 650/MWh and decreases 5 % for each additional 10 MW registered in the SRM. The reference tariff applies differently depending on the renewable energy technology used. It is 100% for solar (i.e., the full EUR 650/MWh), 70% for wind, 30% for hydro, cogeneration and biomass. For fuel cells, the tariff is the one that applies to the renewable energy source used for hydrogen production. As of October 2010, the Decree Law 118-A/2010 modifies some aspects of Microgeneration Law DL 363/2007 . This amendment intends to support the generation of electricity from renewable sources in Low voltage systems by simplifying the application procedure. The new regulation increases the annual ceiling for installation to 25 MW per year and streamlines the access to the Micro Production regime for public, social, education, defense and local institutions. Moreover, the Bonified Regime is adjusted to the cost of equipments used in the Micro production and can only be accesssed under certain conditions, namely the compliance with energy efficiency measures and the use of solar thermal collectors or biomass boilers.

{"Policy": "Enhanced Provisions under the Building Code", "Policy_Content": "The current Building Act was passed in 2004 and it requires the efficient use of energy, including new principles to drive energy conservation and facilitate the use of renewable energy.New buildings are required to be designed, constructed and able to be used in ways that promote sustainable development. In response to the 2004 Act, a major review of the Building Code began in 2004, including a complete review of the energy efficiency requirements of the current Code and future energy needs. During 2004, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) and the Department of Building and Housing worked to further enhance energy in the Building Code.The thermal properties of windows are now included in the Code for residential buildings so that most new residential construction in the cooler parts of the country are double-glazed. Various technical research reports have been completed to underpin the major review of the energy requirements of the New Zealand Building Code.To further improve the energy performance of residential buildings, the New Zealand Government amended the Building Code in 2007/08 so new homes require more insulation (in ceilings, walls and floors) and double glazed windows. These requirements apply to all new houses, major extensions to existing houses, to new multi-unit residential apartments, and to new small buildings with a floor area up to 300 square meters (e.g. small shops). It is estimated that houses built to the new Code requirements consume about 30% less energy than houses built to the old Code requirements.

Such holistic calculation accounts for heating controls and heat-supply system efficiency.A prescriptive model, in which individual elements of the building envelope face required thermal resistance values.Choice between means of compliance falls to the buildings owner and/or designer, though industrial buildings may comply only through the prescriptive path. New code requirements for windows account for the temperature differences near cold surfaces to calibrate an indoor air temperature of 20 degrees C. The 2003 code classifies and rates new, renovated and existing buildings according to thermal performance and energy consumption. Those buildings with exceeding the design or normalized specific energy consumption of code stipulated level by between 10 and 50 percent (High) and more than 51 percent (Very high) would qualify for economic incentives, though administration of these was left to sub-national goverments. These same regional and municipal agencies were responsible for enforcing the federal code, and for administering the energy audits of all new buildings prior to their occupancy.

{"Policy": "Climate Change Act", "Policy_Content": "<div>The Act provides a long-term framework to improve carbon management, to help the transition to a low carbon economy, encourage investment in low carbon goods and provide an international signal. The Act establishes a legally binding target for the UK to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. It also creates 5-yearly 'carbon budgets' as a pathway to meet the long-term target. The Act has now established a legally binding target of at least an 100% cut in GHG emissions by 2050, to be achieved through action in the UK and abroad. Ministers must report on the policies implemented to meet carbon budgets and produce an annual report to Parliament on the status of UK emissions. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) - an independent, expert body to advise the government on the level of carbon budgets and on progress in meeting these budgets - submits annual reports to Parliament on progress towards targets and budgets. The government must respond to the reports, ensuring transparency and accountability.&nbsp;<br><br>The Act sets up a carbon budgeting system that caps emissions over 5-year periods, with three budgets set at a time, to help the UK stay on track for its 2050 target. The first three carbon budgets run from 2008-2012, 2013-2017 and 2018-2022, and were set in law in May 2009. The fourth carbon budget, for 2023-2027 approved by parliament in 2011 and reviewed in 2014, puts into law a target to reduce emissions by 50% from 1990 levels by 2025 (the midpoint of the budget period). The government must report to Parliament its policies and proposals to meet the budgets and set a limit on the purchase of carbon credits for each budgetary period - for the first budgetary period, a zero limit was set in May 2009, excluding units bought by UK participants in the EU Emissions Trading System. For the second budget period, a limit of 55MtCO2e was set.&nbsp;<br><br>The Act also gives powers to introduce domestic emissions trading schemes more quickly and easily through secondary legislation - the first use has been to introduce the Carbon Reduction Commitment Energy Efficiency Scheme. The Act introduced measures on biofuels and powers to introduce pilot financial incentive schemes in England for household waste. The Act requires, by the end of 2012, the inclusion of international aviation and shipping emissions in the net carbon account, or an explanation to Parliament why not. The government announced in December 2012 that this decision would be deferred, recognising uncertainty over the international framework for reducing aviation emissions and particularly the treatment of aviation within the EU ETS. The new net zero target still excludes aviation and shipping.&nbsp;<br><br>The government must report at least every 5 years on the risks to the UK of climate change, and publish a programme setting out how these will be addressed. The first such climate change risk assessment was published in 2012. The Act also introduces powers for government to require public bodies and statutory undertakers to carry out their own risk assessment and make plans to address those risks. The Act introduces an Adaptation Sub-Committee of the Committee on Climate Change, providing advice to, and scrutiny of, the Government's adaptation work. ****** The fifth carbon budget (adopted in June 2016) has set emission reduction levels to 57% compared with 1990 levels. It covers the period between 2028-2032 and is in line with the UK's global commitments.

The switchover will take place in phases: it should cover 70% of all customers by the end of 2017. This timeframe is very ambitious and represents a great challenge for network operators. Extensive reporting obligations to the authorities were therefore imposed. As of December 2015, approximately 456,000 metering points were equipped with a smart meter (there are approximately 6 million metering points in total). This corresponds to a degree of coverage of approximately 7.4% (in 2014 it was 4.9 %).The major roll-out projects tend to be carried out by large network operators or public utilities. According to the companies, the main obstacle to the smooth and rapid introduction of smart meters is the legal framework, which at present is still lacking or is insufficiently clear.

{"Policy": "Germany's Renewables Energy Act", "Policy_Content": "As of 14 December 2020, Germany's ruling coalition agreed modifications to its energy law to create the legal basis for continuing the expansion of renewable energy in the long term and help the country meet its goal of producing 65% of its electricity from clean sources from 2030.  The law came into force as of 1 January 2021. It seeks to help ensure that both electricity supply and electricity consumption become carbon-neutral before 2050. To this end, the law specifies the pace at which sustainable energy such as wind and photovoltaics are to be expanded over the next few years.  For the first time, the 2021 Renewable Energy Sources Act provides for annual monitoring, which can be used to make adjustments if necessary. Germany\u2019s renewable energy levy, the surcharge in consumers\u2019 electricity bills that goes to support renewables, will be EUR 0.065 (USD 0.077) per kWh next year, reduced from EUR 0.06756 in 2020. Average households will see power prices fall by 1%. German consumers can look forward to lower energy bills next year after a reduction in a surcharge they pay to support renewable power. The transmission grid companies -- which include Elia\u2019s 50Hertz, Dutch Tennet, EnBW\u2019s Transnet BW and Amprion -- said the cap on the surcharge at 6.5 cents would require 10.8 billion euros of federal support payments.  The government also decided that the fee would fall further to 6.0 cents in 2022 to relieve customers from cost burdens in the fight against the economic fallout from the coronavirus. The Federal Cabinet passed the amendment to the Renewable Energy Sources Act, the so-called EEG amendment 2021. The amendment to the Federal Requirements Plan Act with regulations on the expansion of the electricity grid was also passed in the cabinet. With regard to coal mine methane emissions, this act provides a guaranteed fixed payback tariff for 20 years through feed-in tariffs or fees paid for electricity produced from previously approved Coal Mine Methane (CMM) or Abandoned Mine Methane (AMM) projects (Sec. 25). CMM operators have the authority to sell the carbon credits generated by the project and have the added incentive of paying no local taxes or royalties on CMM projects. This act also provides a framework for integrating CMM to the grid (Sec. 8) by requiring grid system operators to quickly connect installations for the generation of electricity from renewable energy sources and from mine gas to their grid at a suitable point.  Update 26 November 2021: In order to meet its renewable energy targets, the Federation and the L\u00e4nder established a new Bund/L\u00e4nder Cooperation Committee under the Renewable Energy Sources Act. According to a new report published by the Federation and the L\u00e4nder, the targets are not to be fulfilled if new wind-power projects are not approved.

{"Policy": "Energy-Wise Councils Partnership", "Policy_Content": "Councils are significant users of energy in their own right but, more importantly, they heavily influence their community's use of energy through planning, waste, transport and emissions control policies. Accordingly the Energywise Council Partnership between local government and the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Authority (EECA) was launched in 1999. The Partnership involves 21 of the country's largest councils who are particularly active in energy management issues or see energy efficiency or renewable energy as an important area of focus within their community. The purpose of the Partnership is to foster improved energy efficiency, energy conservation and greater supply of renewable energy consistent with the sustainable management of natural and physical resources.  The local government partners commit to specific actions and cooperative endeavours with technical, marketing and advisory support from EECA. EECA has developed this as a pilot programme and it is now up to councils to continue the energy efficiency, energy conservation and renewable energy gains identified through the partnership model. EECA administers crown loans which assist councils with projects to assist energy efficiency and renewable energy. Another of the ways which EECA has been working with councils is through assisting the development of regional energy strategies, which involve local councils assessing and developing strategies for their local energy resources.  In another initiative working with local government, EECA has been promoting a pilot programme of \"voluntary targeted rates\" whereby ratepayers can elect to pay-off an insulation and clean heating retrofit of their homes by adding the cost to their rates bill and paying it off over a 10 year period.

{"Policy": "Government-wide Programme for a Circular Economy", "Policy_Content": "To ensure that in 2050 everyone has enough to eat and can buy the goods they need, like clothing and electrical devices, our economy needs to become circular. In a circular economy there is no waste. That\u2019s because products are better designed and materials are reused as much as possible. To achieve this, the Government-wide Programme for a Circular Economy, entitled 'A Circular Economy in the Netherlands by 2050', was presented to the House of Representatives on 14 September 2016. The programme sets out what we need to do in order to utilise our raw materials, products, and services in more efficient and smarter ways, thus enabling us to realise the ambition - the Netherlands circular by 2050. A great deal of circular efforts have already been initiated, yet more is needed, and we must and can step up the pace. In this transition, many parties can and are willing to participate: companies, governments, knowledge institutes, NGOs and many more. It is now up to these organisations and the people active within them. The National Agreement on the Circular Economy marks the starting point for the concerted efforts. The agreement will underpin the development of transition agendas.The government has selected 5 economic sectors and value chains that will be the first to switch to a circular economy. These 5 priorities are important to the Dutch economy and have a big impact on the environment. Much is already being done in these sectors to move towards a circular economy, both in the Netherlands and in Europe. The 5 economic sectors are: biomass and food, plastics, manufacturing industry, construction sector and consumer goods.

The first cycle of the PAT Scheme (2012-2015) managed to reduce the energy consumption of more than 400 energy-intensive enterprises (known as Designated Consumers  -DCs) by 5.3%, above the initial target of 4.1%. The targets were originally established based on annual specific energy consumption for each DC in 2010 (baseline year) and adjusted to account for factors such as product mix, capacity utilisation, change in fuel quality, import/export of power and other factors.Following the evaluation of the first cycle, all sectors surpassed their targets except for the thermal power generation sector, which had the highest target of the 8 subsectors covered under the PAT programme. The reason for this was mainly due to the unavailability of new efficient natural gas power plants and partly due to lower than expected electricity demand from the thermal generation sector, which subsequently led to a reduction in power plant performance.Overall, majority of the DCs implemented relatively low cost measures, such as changes to process control and installation of variable speed drives on electric motors, which were financed through the DCs own resources. In terms of sector specific interventions, for example, in the cement industry the most common measures covered installation of waste heat recovery systems and vertical rolling mills. In the iron and steel sector, measures included installation of top recovery turbines and adoption of coke dry quenching process.The trading of energy saving certificates (ESCerts) is central to the PAT programme and serves as an incentive to reach or surpass the mandatory targets. The ESCerts, equivalent to 1 tonne of oil equivalent (toe) of energy savings, are given based on quantified energy savings verified by an accredited energy auditor. The ESCerts are awarded after a DC surpasses its target and can then be sold to another DC that has failed to achieve its target, the price for which is determined through market supply and demand. The ESCerts can also be banked for next PAT cycles of the respective DC to contribute towards meeting future targets as the PAT programme expands.The Central Electricity Regulatory Commission acts as the market regulator by defining the regulatory framework for trading of the ESCerts, while the Power System Operation Corporation is responsible for the centralized ESCert registry. The Bureau of Energy Efficiency is the administrator and developed a platform to manage the ESCert trading process. Starting from April 2017, the Indian Energy Exchange and the Power Exchange of India will manage ESCert trading (until now no ESCerts had been traded). The demand for ESCerts is expected to be relatively low, given that about 3.8 million ESCerts have been issued of which about 1.5 million need to be absorbed by the DCs who are falling short of targets.If a DC has not met its target and fails to purchase sufficient ESCerts to compensate for its shortfall, it will be subject to a penalty. The penalty for non-compliance is 1 million INR (about 15 000 USD) plus the value of the energy savings that have not been obtained by the DC, measured in toe. The price of 1 toe is determined by a combination of coal, fuel, gas and electricity prices as declared by the Indian government. For example, the cost of coal is based on the price of F-grade coal declared by the Ministry of Coal multiplied by the amount of coal consumed by the 478 DCs and the total energy consumed in the 478 DCs. In 2011-2012, the market value of 1 toe was approximately 10 154 INR (approximately 151 USD) and in 2014-2015 it was 10 968 INR (approximately 160                                                                                                   ", "law or strategy": "Preparatory Instruments", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": "Multi-sector;Energy systems;Industry", "subsector": "Energy systems:Electricity & heat", "Instrument": "Information Programmes;Government Provision of Public Goods or Services;Regulatory Approaches;Subsidies", "Sector-Instrument": "Regulatory Approaches:Efficiency or environmental performance standards;Information Programmes:Energy audits;Regulatory Approaches:Energy efficiency standards for equipment", "objective": "Economic", "subobjective": "Economic:Productivity/competitiveness", "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "National"}

{"Policy": "Promotion Law of New and Renewable Energy Development Republic of Korea (1987)", "Policy_Content": "Overview\n\"The Act on the Promotion of the Development, Use, and Diffusion of New and Renewable Energy\" defines new and renewable energy as energy resources converted from existing fossil fuel resources or renewable energy sources, including the sun, water, geothermal heat, precipitation, and bio-organisms. The Act identifies 11 such resources, including solar energy, bioenergy, wind power, hydro power, fuel cells, liquefied or gasified coal, gasified heavy oil residue, tidal power, waste-to-energy, geothermal energy, and hydrogen energy. Despite its weak economic feasibility due to the lack of price competitiveness and the high initial investment costs, new and renewable energy is becoming increasingly important and necessary as a key solution to fossil fuel depletion and other environmental issues. As of 2012, the penetration rate of new and renewable energy was 3.18% that of primary energy. This rate rose by 10.9% annually on average from 2008 to 2012, almost three times faster than the 3.7% annual average growth of primary energy penetration during the same period. Waste-to-energy and bioenergy represented 80% of the entire new/renewable energy supply base, while solar energy and wind power accounted for just 5%.\n\nBackground\nSince Korea is heavily dependent on overseas markets for its energy needs and deeply and extensively affected by oil price changes, stable demand/supply management has always been a priority. The Korean Government therefore established and announced the \"Alternative Energy Development Promotion Act\" in December 1987 and started to provide support for technology development in 1988.\n\nObjective\nIn September 2014, the government released the \"Fourth Basic Plan for Technology Development, Application, and Deployment of New & Renewable Energy (2014-2035)\" which is aimed at increasing the share of new and renewable energy in total energy consumption to 11% by 2035. This master plan consists of detailed development and distribution plans for each type of new and renewable energy. The plan is not only ambitious but also presents a feasible penetration goal based on a rigorous analysis of geographical conditions, technology levels, and marketability. Under this plan, the Korean government seeks to develop solar energy and wind power as key resources while reducing the proportion of waste-derived energy.\n\nPolicies\nUnder this policy, MOTIE promotes voluntary private investment by providing a more market-friendly system, profitable business models, relaxed regulations, and suitable diffusion models, with the aim of building a new/renewable energy industry ecosystem on the basis of public-private partnership as opposed to traditional government-led efforts. MOTIE also seeks to establish a virtuous cycle between overseas expansion and domestic distribution by looking beyond the Korean market and sharpening global competitiveness. The following paragraphs provide further details on policy strategies.\n\nConsumer-oriented supply and diffusion\nMOTIE will employ and spread revenue models that are backed by consumer participation (e.g. collaboration with residents, eco-friendly energy towns), which would increase the use of new/renewable energy through the participation of the general public and sharing of results.

The calculator has the following key \"selling points\": - the data and calculations have been recognised by government; - the results can be customised to individuals or households; - three lifestyle areas (domestic heating, electrical appliance use and personal travel) are brought together in one calculator; - advice is tailored to the individual, rather than generic; and - recommendations are given on reducing and avoiding wasted energy, rather than simply offsetting.

The goals of the Decathlon are to:1) educate the student participants - the \"decathletes\" - about the benefits of energy efficiency, renewable energy and green building technologies;2) raise awareness among the general public about renewable energy and energy efficiency and how solar energy technologies can reduce energy use;3) help solar energy technologies enter the marketplace faster;4) foster collaboration among students from different academic disciplines;5) promote an integrated or \"whole building design\" approach to new construction; and6) demonstrate to the public the potential of zero-energy homes, which produce as much energy from renewable sources, such as the sun and wind, as they consume.In FY2016, EERE is moving the Solar Decathalon from the Building Technologies Office to the Strategic Programs Office's Technology-to-Markets subprogram, where it can be better coordinated with the Strategic Programs Office's workforce development and communications resources. The 2017 event will take place in Denver, Colorado in October 2017.", "law or strategy": "Decisional Guidelines, Codes and Frameworks", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": "Buildings", "subsector": NaN, "Instrument": "Information Programmes;Government Provision of Public Goods or Services;Regulatory Approaches;Subsidies", "Sector-Instrument": NaN, "objective": "Economic", "subobjective": "Economic:Technological spillover/innovation;Economic:Productivity/competitiveness", "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "International"}
{"Policy": "Global Gas Flaring Reduction partnership (GGFR) United States of America (2002)", "Policy_Content": "The World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) is a multi-donor trust fund composed of governments, oil companies, and multilateral organizations committed to ending routine gas flaring at oil production sites across the world.   During oil production, the associated natural gas is often flared (burned) when economic, regulatory or technical barriers to the development of gas markets and gas infrastructure prevent it from being used or when re-injecting the associated gas back into the reservoir is not possible.  GGFR helps identify solutions to the array of technical and regulatory barriers to flaring reduction. To achieve this, we develop country-specific flaring reduction programs, conduct research, share best practices, raise awareness, secure global commitments to end routine flaring, and advance flare measurements and reporting.  GGFR advocates for ending routine gas flaring by garnering commitments for the Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative (ZRF). Governments and companies that endorse ZRF commit to no routine flaring in any new oil field developments and to end routine flaring at existing (legacy) oil production sites as soon as possible and no later than 2030.   Ending poverty and boosting shared prosperity is an integral part of GGFR\u2019s strategy. Natural gas resources help countries move toward a more sustainable energy path, and flaring wastes a valuable energy resource that could be used to advance the development of producing countries. For example, if this amount of gas were used for power generation, it could provide about 750 billion kWh of electricity, or more than the African continent\u2019s current annual electricity consumption.

The fuel consumption tax NoVa was introduced in 1992. This tax has to be paid at the time of purchasing a new car and is based on the fuel consumption specifications of the car. The Structural Adjustment Act in 1996 led to an increase in this tax rate of about 1% by changing the way fuel consumption is measured. At the same time, the maximum tax rate was raised from 14% to 16%. Since the fuel consumption tax increases the tax burden depending on the vehicle's relative fuel consumption, this measure offers incentives for the purchase of energy-efficient vehicles. In recent years a strong trend towards diesel powered vehicles reduced the average fuel consumption. In 1996 diesel powered vehicles accounted for 50% of all new registrations compared to 22% before the introduction of the fuel consumption levy. Diesel vehicles currently hold a share of 40% to 50% of the total passenger vehicle fleet compared to 5% in the mid-1980s. The car registration tax has to be paid for each month in which a vehicle is registered and has a number-plate, the prerequisite to use public roads. The level of the tax depends on engine specification and it is paid to the insurance company together with the liability insurance premiums.

By doing so Portugal aims to reduce its external dependence, which translates into increased supply safety.Axis 3 - PROMOTION OF ENERGY EFFICIENCY by targeting a 20% reduction in overall energy consumption by 2020, through both behavioural and fiscal measures, as well as through innovative projects, namely electric vehicles and smart grids, renewable-based decentralised production, and the optimisation of public lighting models and energy management of public, residential and services buildings.Axis 4 - GUARANTEEING SECUTITY OF ENERGY SUPPLY by sticking to a policy of a wide energy mix of both sources and supply origins, and by strengthening transport and storage infrastructures which will allow the consolidation of the Iberian market in accordance with European energy policy guidelines.Axis 5 - SUSTAINING THE ENERGY STRATEGY - ENE 2020 promotes economic and environmental sustainability as crucial to the success of the energy policy, by resorting to instruments of fiscal policy, to some revenue generated in the energy sector by CO2 emission allowances, and other revenues generated by the renewable energy sector, for the creation of a tariff equilibrium fund that enables a continuous renewable energy growth process.

Under the PROINFA rules, the programme will be operated by Electrobr\u00e1s, which will buy energy at pre-set preferential prices (\"economic values\" for each of the three sources) and will market \"renewable\" electricity. Definitive \"economic values\" will be published at the end of October 2003 and will have a reference value floor of 70% of the national average supply tariff. Contracts between Electrobr\u00e1s and the \"renewable\" generator are valid for a period of 20 years, are applicable to plants that began production before 2007 and must be signed within 24 months of the publication of Law 10438. The Banco Nacional de Desenvolvimento Econ\u00f4mico e Social (BNDES, the Brazilian National Development Bank) will make special financing programmes available for renewables projects that are eligible for PROINFA. BNDES can finance up to 70% of capital costs (excluding site acquisition and imported goods and services) at the basic national interest rates (TJLP) plus 2% of basic spread and up to 1.5% of risk spread. Interests are not charged during construction and amortization is of 10 years. Payments are due 6 months after commercial operation. Eletrobr\u00e1s guarantees in the long-term electricity purchasing contracts a minimum income of 70% of the contracted energy during the financing period, as well as a full coverage to exposure risks to the short-term market PROINFA is expected to generate 150 thousand jobs and to leverage private investments of around USD 2.6 bln. Law 10762 mandates a minimum nationalization of 60% in total construction costs, as well as a regionalization criteria, where each State has maximum limits of 20% of total capacity for wind and biomass and 15% for small hydros. Such limits are preliminary: if part of the 1100 MW for each source is not contracted, this available potential will be distributed according to the older environmental permits (all projects are required to have a previous installation licence).\n \n\nSTAGE II: Once the 3,300 MW objective has been met, PROINFA will target increasing the share of electricity produced by three renewable sources to 10% of annual consumption within 20 years.

The Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) is the main certification standard for the use of palm oil and its fractions in food and oleo-chemicals. Currently 20% of palm oil worldwide is RSPO certified. Founded in 2004, it is a multi-stakeholder, non-profit group that unites seven sectors of the palm oil industry in regular dialogue, including investors, growers, retailers and NGOs, using a consensus voting system to develop standards and criteria on an on-going basis. It uses a business-tobusiness model to encourage the adoption of sustainable practices by members (particularly producers) and promotes the uptake of certified sustainable palm oil internationally. While voluntary, it requires that companies abide by national laws and requirements. The Principles and Criteria, which form the basis of the RSPO certification scheme, comprise eight basic principles: Commitment to Transparency; Compliance with Applicable Laws and Regulations; Commitment to Long\u2013term Economic and Financial Viability; Use of appropriate Best Practices by Growers and Millers; Environmental Responsibility and Conservation of Natural Resources and Biodiversity; Responsible Consideration of Employees and of Individuals and Communities Affected by Growers and Mills; Responsible Development of New Plantings; and Commitment to Continuous Improvement in Key Areas of Activity. In order to claim compliance with the P&C and achieve RSPO certification, growers must be assessed by a third-party RSPO-accredited certification body every five years, with an annual audit for continued compliance. The current P&C can be found here on the RSPO website, with a breakdown of the indicators and guidance on how to become certified. Members of the RSPO must submit Annual Communications of Progress (ACOP) reports in order to assess their progress towards producing and procuring RSPO-certified sustainable palm oil to any of the four supply chain models for RSPO Certified Sustainable Palm Oil (CSPO): identity preserved, segregated, mass balance, and book and claim (see here for more information on supply chain models). A crucial component of the ACOPs are Timebound plans (TBPs), in which members must state clear timelines for producing or sourcing 100% RSPO CSPO.

Transversal measures: -Encouraging the development of Energy Service Companies (ESCOs), through ensuring legal protection of these companies, providing financing and offering public contracts; -Giving an advantage to certified energy companies (those with a certificate issued by Spains standardisation and certification organisation AENOR) in public contracts; - Doubling the budget for the governments Institute for Energy Saving and Diversification (IDEA) to EUR 120 million in order to support strategic projects by large companies and industrial groups; - Agreements signed in the course of 2008 with Consumer and User Boards for these associations to carry out training and information campaigns on energy-saving measures and benefits. Mobility: - In collaboration with the autonomous regions and local authorities, a pilot project will be carried out to demonstrate the technical, energetic and economic viability of electric vehicles. The goal of this project, with the agreement of the automobile sector, will be to have one million electric or hybrid vehicles by 2014; - The Spanish general administration will establish preferential criteria within the public contracting procedures for energy efficiency Class A passenger vehicles. In addition, by 2009 the public vehicle pool will be required to use a minimum of 20% biofuels. - The necessary regulations will be developed to ensure the objective of 5.83% biofuels in automobile fuel consumption is met by 2010; -Establishment of the VIVE (Veh\u00edculo Innovador - Veh\u00edculo Ecol\u00f3gico, Innovative Vehicle - Ecological Vehicle) Plan, to be in effect until 2010. VIVE will replace nearly 240 000 vehicles over 15 years old; - Vehicle manufacturers will be required to inform consumers on the emissions and energy consumption of new vehicles for sale by means of a comparative energy label; - A proposal will be presented to reduce by an average of 20% the speed limits entering large cities and on city ring-roads and high-capacity roads; - Campaigns are to be conducted, notifying and informing citizens about efficient driving techniques, such as the importance of tyre pressure for fuel consumption; - A special line of credit will be negotiated with the European Investment Bank to support sustainable urban mobility plans, enabling cities and towns to improve public transport systems, seek alternative routes, buy efficient vehicles, etc. Energy efficiency criteria will also be included in determining the Spanish administrations contribution towards financing public transport with City Councils; - Mobile telephone network operators will be required to guarantee coverage on underground public transportation networks in all Spanish cities; - Agreements are to be reached with autonomous regions and local authorities to extend the underground public transportation operating hours on the weekend; - Promotion of bicycle use through agreements with local authorities, supporting the implementation of public-use bicycle systems and urban cycling lanes; - In cities with populations of over 500,000, lanes reserved for collective passenger transport, known has HOV lanes, will be established by 2012; - The Spanish general administration will put in place worker mobility plans for centres with over 100 employees, including establishing bus routes based on the workers places of residence ; - Air routes will be optimised using the Ministry of Defences air corridors, reducing the length                                                                                                   ", "law or strategy": "Preparatory Instruments", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": "Transport;Buildings;Multi-sector;AFOLU", "subsector": NaN, "Instrument": "Information Programmes;Government Provision of Public Goods or Services;Regulatory Approaches;Subsidies", "Sector-Instrument": NaN, "objective": "Economic", "subobjective": "Economic:Technological spillover/innovation;Economic:Productivity/competitiveness", "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "National"}

{"Policy": "Climate Investment Programmes", "Policy_Content": "Starting in 2003, the Swedish government has provided a funding mechanism that supports municipalities and other local players (including county councils, municipal associations and companies) with long-term investments that reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.  The programme has granted funding for 125 climate investment projects, as well as 22 special programmes (known as 'guldklimpar'). Guldklimpar are particularly effective measures that have been granted funding in programmes that have not been granted other funding. The programmes comprise 879 measures and an investment volume of about EUR 860 million, SEK 8 billion. Funding requests are studied and grants provided for investment in the sectors that have the largest impact on GHG mitigation. This generally applies to measures in the transport, waste and energy sectors. They include expansion of district heating, anaerobic digestion of waste to produce biogas, transition to biofuels, measures to boost energy efficiency and local information measures to increase awareness on climate change and on the ongoing investment projects. The Swedish Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) studies the funding applications along with sector agencies, such as the Swedish Road Administration or the National Board of Housing, Building and Planning. The climate investment programmes normally run for four years, after which a final report is submitted to the EPA. This is when decisions are made on how much final funding is payable to those who have made investments, depending on how well they have met their objectives. In 2007 final reports from the climate investment programmes started being submitted to the EPA. The fifth and final round of funding grants was awarded in May 2008. In the 45 Climate Investment Programmes (Klimp) so far completed up to March 2010 throughout Sweden,  the projects carried out have led to a reduction in Swedish emissions of greenhouse gases of around 260,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per year. In the 81 Climate Investment Programmes that are still active, the projects are expected to lead to  further reductions in emissions totalling almost 700,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents per year. In total, 913 projects have been or are being carried out by municipalities, companies and other organisations. Investments amounting to approximately 7.6 billion kronor are expected to be made, with the aid of grants of just over 1.7 billion kronor, up until 2012.

{"Policy": "Energy Labelling of Larger Buildings (Eco-scheme)", "Policy_Content": "The energy labelling of buildings in Denmark was developed in the context of a long history of energy saving policy initiatives. Energy labelling was and is still seen as an important way to achieve energy savings in buildings - both existing and new - since the potential for energy savings in these areas is considered quite large. The annual supervision of larger buildings (more than 1 500 square metres) is carried out by between 500 and 700 specially trained consultants. About 25 000 buildings are concerned. Every month all buildings, except industrial buildings, and those with very low energy consumption, with a surface of more than 1 500 square metres must register their consumption of heat, electricity and water. Once a year, a consultant makes an audit comprising an Energy Label and an Energy Plan. The Energy Label evaluates the consumption of heat, electricity and water on scales from A to M (A is best) in comparison with average figures for comparable buildings. The Energy Plan informs the building owner about relevant measures for energy saving in the short and long run. This programme replaces the VKO programme (statutory heat inspection of larger heat furnaces) in operation since 1981. The new programme was evaluated in 2000 and the major conclusions were that the programme works very well for those who participate in it, but around half of the buildings still do not fulfil the requirements. Lack of awareness of the existence of the programmes contributed to non-participation. The energy savings in the buildings following the programme are larger than in those outside the scheme. Furthermore, the investments in energy savings are more focused in buildings participating in the programme and those responsible for energy are more aware of the results of investments.

{"Policy": "Infrastructure investment", "Policy_Content": "In its plan for 2011  2014, the Swedish Transport Administration (including previously separate Swedish Board for Road Administration) aims at making the total energy usage of roads and railways more efficient. According to some estimates, 10 % of energy use in the transport sector originates from construction, maintenance, and operation of infrastructure. Measures include the choice and production of materials, and methods of construction. It also involves design and choices of speed limits. With a long-term perspective, the Swedish Transport Administration assumes it can influence the energy consumption of future transport systems at the planning, design or construction stage. The Transport Administration has introduced energy efficiency as a focal area in its activities. The purpose is to find new measures for energy efficiency in investment projects which can be assumed to be disseminated. All subcontractors are encouraged to suggest more energy efficient methods for building roads and railways. For several years, the Transport Administration has worked with a lighting strategy by switching off unnecessary lighting, introducing more energy efficient equipment, and by removing lighting from roads to bicycle and pedestrian paths. Moreover, the operation and maintenance of infrastructure requires considerable amounts of energy, in the form of both fuel and electricity. The Swedish Transport Administration also develops energy procurement requirements and follow-ups on contractors and fuel use in various operational areas. Lighting and tunnel fans will be placed optimally and be fitted with timers. Climate-conscious road traffic management can also make a contribution. Service and maintenance must also be optimized to reduce the amount of energy consumed by transport and business. In addition to these measures, eco-driving has been introduced on road ferries (e.g. cable ferries where appropriate), while energy efficiency is highlighted on airport services and harbors, e.g. lighthouses have been equipped with energy efficient lamps. In rail transportation there is also significant scope for improvement. The Transport Administration estimates thanks to a pilot project in 2013 in the railway yard of city of \u00f6stersund, that installation of new switch equipment may save up to 50 % of energy used. This would imply a potential of 74 GWh in total in Sweden.

Low interest loan programme for energy conservation renovation of buildings: Targeted for energy conservation renovation projects for existing buildings using ESCOs (Energy Service Company), companies that provide energy efficiency improvement services and advice to the client. Funds may be provided to execute these projects by a way of leasing or an Energy Service Provider (ESP). This business provides expertise on energy conservation measures, managing multiple workplaces in an integrated manner.  2. Low interest loan programme for plans for environmentally-friendly buildings these are provided for specific measures taken in the planning phase, such as energy conservation measures, roof-top greening projects, etc.  3. Tax Scheme for Promoting Investment in the Reform of the Energy Demand-Supply Structure This scheme is available for businesses that acquire specified energy conservation equipment. It provides special depreciation rate applied for 30% of the acquisition cost (small scale businesses are provided with the option of a 7 % tax deduction of the acquisition cost). Demand leveling facilities and multiplexing electricity distribution facilities benefit from a special depreciation rate applying to 50% of the acquisition cost. Since fiscal year 2006, highly-efficient equipment and systems used in the residential and commercial sectors, such as highly efficient air conditioning systems, high insulation windows facilities, and light-emitting diodes, are covered by this scheme.  4. The Japan Housing Finance Agency (JHF) (previously Government Housing Loan Corporation, GHLC) allows for lower interest rates and preferential loans to be provided for energy efficient houses. The GHLC provided an extra loan for houses meeting energy saving performance, earthquake resistance performance or elderly and handicapped performance technical standards set by the GHLC.  For energy performance, all the houses for which the loan was requested had to meet at least the 1980 thermal insulation standard. On top of that, an extra loan was provided for those meeting the 1992 or 1999 standards. In 2003 direct loans were no longer provided, and the JHF began underwriting a long-term and fixed interest rate loan called \"Flat 35\", with energy conservation performance one of the items evaluated to determine loan conditions. All houses applying for the loan must meet 1980 thermal insulation standards, and reduced interest rates are provided for those meeting the 1999 standards.  5.

Working groups with representatives from the Manitoba Department of Energy, Science and Technology; the Ontario Ministry of Energy; Manitoba Hydro; Hydro One; and the Ontario Independent Electricity Market Operator; evaluated various aspects of a long-term power supply arrangement between Manitoba and Ontario with an incremental 1500 MW of transfer capacity. The preliminary assessment indicates that the benefits associated with the Clean Energy Transfer Initiative (CETI) could be significant, that there are no insurmountable obstacles, and that while challenges remain, progress has been made in clarifying and resolving a number of potential issues. It is recommended that the project move into its next stage. The Clean Energy Transfer Initiative would contribute to addressing Ontario\u2019s increasing electricity supply needs. Population and economic growth, existing generation facilities reaching the end of their design life, and the planned phase-out of coal fired generation result in a potential supply gap in Ontario as high as 25,000 MW by 2020, in the absence of other initiatives. The Clean Energy Transfer Initiative is viewed as one of the potential initiatives that could be pursued to help address Ontario\u2019s electricity needs.

{"Policy": "Inter-ministerial climate change commission Mexico (2005)", "Policy_Content": "As a developing country, Mexico adopts poverty erradication as an absolute priority, and avoids policies that may jeopardize economic growth. As such, climate change is both a threat and an opportunity to foster sustainable development, insomuch as risks associated with climate change itself and with potential response measures (given that Mexico is an oil exporting nation), can be avoided. Mexico\u2019s policy on climate change is a staged response, in which the consolidation of national capacities (institutions, legal framework, actions, monitoring and evaluation) is achieved step by step. For example, while the Climate Change Office was set up in 2003 and the Inter-Ministerial Climate Change Commission established in April 2005, the Law on Renewable Energy is still being drawn up. National capacity building evolves around seven functional clusters, of which the first, the preparation of GHG Inventories and National Communications, is crucial for all the rest, as monitoring progress on prevention and mitigation requires reliable baselines. Formulating policies, coordinating actions, R & D, promoting mitigation projects (AIJ, CDM), the participation of civil society and effective participation in climate change negotiations, constitute the other six functional clusters. Among the concrete measeures implemented by Mexico, PEMEX has instituted a virtual cap and trade on CO2 emissions unparalelled elsewhere, which is in the planning stages of becoming a real exchange process. Mexico was also the first Non-Annex I country to produce a second National Communicaction, in 2001. At present, a new GHG Inventory and a new National Strategy for Climate Action \u2013 this last in collaboration with the Mario Molina Center \u2013 are both in progress, and expected to be published late in 2005. A third National Communication will be published late in 2006. Mexico, like other Latin American countries, supports the CDM, but considers that while useful for inducing positive institutional arrangements, it has largely failed to live up to expectations: Its effectiveness is percieved as relatively poor, its transaction costs are high and it has the potential to become a perverse incentive, limiting developing countries\u2019 mobilization of their own full potential, when improved national legislation and policies threaten to undermine the requisite proof of additionality for individual CDM projects. Mexico\u2019s medium to long term strategy on climate change embraces several conceptual standpoints, including the need for greater differentiation of responsabilities among advanced developing nations. Also, while other Parties\u2019 non-compliance should not affect Mexico\u2019s own compliance, it could affect the scope of its commitments. Nevertheless, Mexico is against sanctions for non-compliance. While Mexico foresees some limited success in mitigation achievements, it will require international support to go beyond these: Mexico considers that over-compliance should win compensation. Equity concerns are essential to Mexico, and per capita emissions and their evolution should play a more central role in the international regime, on the basis of flexible convergence in accordance with national circumstances. Furthermore, a need to go beyond isolated projects to tackle entire sectors of the economy, in accordance with their readiness to act, is also essential. There is also a need to review the potential effectiveness of the \u201cemissions intensity\u201d approach, which may be less effective when compared with the carbon efficiency standards per unit of product or service approach.

Within these actions, SISCLIMA will co-ordinate the implementation of the four climate change priority strategies defined by the government: CCNAP, CLCDS, ENREDD+ and the Strategy for Fiscal Protection Against Natural Disasters. It is expected that these strategies will need to formulate their own financing strategy and to add a component for private sector investment.<br />\n<br />\nThe proposed approach is one whereby climate change initiatives will be built through a bottom-up approach. Four permanent committees at the base of the SISCLIMA structure will coordinate, shape and implement sectoral and territorial policy as well as international affairs for climate change adaptation and mitigation based on detailed technical studies carried out on specialised working groups. The Finance Committee (FC) will act as coordinator of financing activities and offer support to those initiatives seeking financial support by directing efforts to identify and coordinate sources of finance available at the national and international levels. Finally, at the very top of the system, the Inter-Sectoral Commission on Climate Change (COMICC) will bring together various ministries and key national institutions to co-ordinate and direct institutional efforts on climate change and act as the connection point between SISCLIMA and the wider government, including the presidency. COMICC will also share findings and guide policy at the highest level of the national government on climate change issues.

Electricity retailers are responsible for acquiring gas savings.  This is a white certificate scheme with tradeable energy savings certificates. Obligated parties and other businesses may apply to become \"Accredited Certificate Providers\" to deliver approved energy efficiency activities under the scheme.  In 2019, the NSW Government announced the scheme will be extended until 2050, with energy savings targets increasing over time to reach 13% by 2030. The obligation programme is also set to be renamed the \"Energy Security Safeguard\". In 2019 and 2020 the NSW Government is also consulting on a peak demand scheme to be developed based on, and alongside the Energy Savings Scheme.  Following a scheme review finalised in 2015, the obligation included a target of 7% annual electricity and gas purchases by retailers, increasing each year to reach 8.5% in 2019, which was to remain steady until 2025.  Calculation of energy savings are based on The Energy Savings Scheme Rule, which includes a combination of deemed energy savings measures, and measurement and verfication based methods.  The scheme administrator conducts audits of energy savings certificates (and thereby projects) across each Accredited Certificate Provider's portfolio, based on their agreed audit regime (which is normally based on an audit trigger at an agreed certificate creation threshold, e.g. every 50,000 certificates).

They are aimed at ensuring that new housing stock in Ireland is built to the highest international standards, where they will be cheaper to run and will have a much lower impact on the environment. The draft Regulations provide for inter alia: - A 40% improvement in energy efficiency for new homes in 2008. - A 40% reduction in CO2 emissions. - A mandatory minimum renewable energy requirement in all new homes, such as solar heating systems or biomass systems eg(wood pellet). - Mandatory levels of energy efficient fixed light fittings - Minimum standards on heating systems to ensure they are highly energy efficient (oil and gas fired boilers must meet minimum seasonal net efficiency of 86% both new buildings; this is to be met where practicable in existing buildings, as of 31 March 2008) - Minimum requirements for heating system controls to minimise energy waste through excessive heating - Air tightness testing, to ensure the homes are not leaking heat excessively. - Guidance on ensuring a minimum quality of workmanship and construction - Consumer information on the efficient operation of the homeowners dwelling as a minimum requirement. - Commitment in the guidelines to review and improve regulations to 60 per cent in 2010 with the ultimate aim of achieving a zero carbon standard for new houses in the medium to long term. - New buildings should also be future-proofed to be easily upgraded to higher energy and CO2 standards in the future The regulations were further amended in the course of 2008, with provisions for them to apply to existing buildings extended. A new methodology to measure the energy demand and CO2 emissions of new non-residential buildings was also introduced, the Non-domestic Energy Assessment Procedure (NEAP). New non-residential buildings msut also meet the requirements set out in section L1 of the building code.

Emphasises energy efficiency and renewable energy sources. The Nauru National Energy Policy Framework (NEPF) has been developed through a consultative process involving stakeholders from the public sector, private sector and civil society groups. The policy framework provides a guideline for the development of the energy sector in Nauru for the immediate future and mid and long term. It has been developed under an integrated planning approach, with the view that the energy policy is only one of the many policy instruments that is being put in place by the Government to ensure that the Nauru economy develops to its full capacity given the many challenges facing the country. The policy framework adheres to the principle of partnerships. It is therefore essential that the involvement of the private sector and civil society groups in the implementation of the policy framework be encouraged. The NEPF is driven by its vision statement: \u201cReliable, affordable and sustainable energy, enabling the socio-economic development of Nauru.\u201d The NSDS comprises of short term, midterm and long-term goals. The NSDS has set a goal of reducing Nauru\u2019s dependence on imported petroleum fuels through a number of strategies. One of these is meeting 50% of its energy needs through renewable energy by 2015. Achieving such a goal is essential to achieving socio-economic stability. The reliability of the power supply in Nauru is highly essential to the achievement of other sector programme goals. For example the goal of supplying reliable water to all households cannot be achieved without a reliable power supply.

{"Policy": "Circular Economy Action Plan European Union (27) (2020)", "Policy_Content": "This Plan complements the Circular Economy Package (2015) and aims at reducing waste and promote the development of a circular economy. There is only one planet Earth, yet by 2050, the world will be consuming as if there were three. Global consumption of materials such as biomass, fossil fuels, metals and minerals is expected to double in the next forty years, while annual waste generation is projected to increase by 70% by 2050. As half of total greenhouse gas emissions and more than 90% of biodiversity loss and water stress come from resource extraction and processing, the European Green Deal launched a concerted strategy for a climate-neutral, resource-efficient and competitive economy. Scaling up the circular economy from front-runners to the mainstream economic players will make a decisive contribution to achieving climate neutrality by 2050 and decoupling economic growth from resource use, while ensuring the long-term competitiveness of the EU and leaving no one behind. To fulfil this ambition, the EU needs to accelerate the transition towards a regenerative growth model that gives back to the planet more than it takes, advance towards keeping its resource consumption within planetary boundaries, and therefore strive to reduce its consumption footprint and double its circular material use rate in the coming decade. For business, working together on creating the framework for sustainable products will provide new opportunities in the EU and beyond. This progressive, yet irreversible transition to a sustainable economic system is an indispensable part of the new EU industrial strategy. A recent study estimates that applying circular economy principles across the EU economy has the potential to increase EU GDP by an additional 0.5% by 2030 creating around 700 000 new jobs. There is a clear business case for individual companies too: since manufacturing firms in the EU spend on average about 40% on materials, closed loop models can increase their profitability, while sheltering them from resource price fluctuations. Building on the single market and the potential of digital technologies, the circular economy can strengthen the EU\u2019s industrial base and foster business creation and entrepreneurship among SMEs. Innovative models based on a closer relationship with customers, mass customisation, the sharing and collaborative economy, and powered by digital technologies, such as the internet of things, big data, blockchain and artificial intelligence, will not only accelerate circularity but also the dematerialisation of our economy and make Europe less dependent on primary materials.  For citizens, the circular economy will provide highquality, functional and safe products, which are efficient and affordable, last longer and are designed for reuse, repair, and high-quality recycling. A whole new range of sustainable services, product-as-service models and digital solutions will bring about a better quality of life, innovative jobs and upgraded knowledge and skills. This Circular Economy Action Plan provides a future-oriented agenda for achieving a cleaner and more competitive Europe in co-creation with economic actors, consumers, citizens and civil society organisations. It aims at accelerating the transformational change required by the European Green Deal, while building on circular economy actions implemented since 2015. This plan will ensure that the regulatory framework is streamlined and made fit for a sustainable future, that the new opportunities from the transition are maximised, while minimising burdens on people and businesses. The plan presents a set of interrelated initiatives to establish a strong and coherent product policy framework that will make sustainable products, services and business models the norm and transform consumption patterns so that no waste is produced in the first place. This product policy framework will be progressively rolled out, while key product value chains will be addressed as a matter of priority. Further measures will be put in place to reduce waste and ensure that the EU has a well-functioning internal market for high quality secondary raw materials. The capacity of the EU to take responsibility for its waste will be also strengthened. Europe will not achieve transformative change by acting alone. The EU will continue to lead the way to a circular economy at the global level and use its influence, expertise and financial resources to implement the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals.

The Australian Government will develop best practice information, training and tools that help the transition to low energy homes, including through updates to the Your Home resource (yourhome.gov.au) and the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme (nathers.gov.au).      New funding will include the expansion of the National Australian Built Environment Energy Ratings System (NABERS) (nabers.gov.au) and consider the expansion of the Commercial Building Disclosure (CBD) program (cbd.gov.au) following the current review of the program.      The CBD program requires owners to advertise the NABERS office energy rating of an office building greater than 1000 square metres when it is offered for lease or sale. Funding will support NABERS to expand its voluntary energy rating tools to include more building types, such as schools, retail stores and industrial buildings. The new NABERS online tool will reduce the cost of ratings through streamlining processes and automatic energy data collection. Disclosing the energy efficiency of a building provides potential owners or tenants with consistent and meaningful information about a building\u2019s performance, making it easier for them to make an informed decision.        The CBD program was reviewed in 2015 and found to be effective at motivating owners of poorly performing office buildings to improve the energy efficiency of those buildings, delivering $44 million in net benefits in its first four years.  The current review is considering whether to expand mandatory disclosure of energy performance to other high energy using classes of commercial building, such as hotels, data centres, office tenancies and shopping centres.  The Australian Government will also develop new information, online tools and case studies for industry on how to upgrade building performance, saving owners and tenants energy and reducing their energy bills. Funding will be provided to develop a stock model and energy use baseline study for non-residential buildings in Australia to chart current and future energy use patterns.", "law or strategy": "Steering Instruments", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": "Buildings", "subsector": "Buildings:Non-residential;Buildings:Residential", "Instrument": "Information Programmes;Government Provision of Public Goods or Services;Regulatory Approaches;Voluntary Actions", "Sector-Instrument": "Regulatory Approaches:Equipment and appliance standards;Information Programmes:Energy advice programmes;Information Programmes:Labelling programmes;Information Programmes:Energy audits;Voluntary Actions:Labelling programmes for efficient buildings", "objective": "Economic", "subobjective": "Economic:Productivity/competitiveness", "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "National"}

{"Policy": "\"Old\" Feed-In Premium for photovoltaic systems (I-II-III-IV Conto Energia)", "Policy_Content": "Decrees issued by the Italian Ministry of Economic Development in July 2005 and in February 2006 introduced a feed-in premium scheme for solar PV generation through which premiums ranging from EUR 0.445/kWh to EUR 0.490/kWh were granted. The subsequent Ministerial Decree of February 19th, 2007 revised the previous feed-in scheme. It was meant for photovoltaic plants connected to the grid with a nominal capacity higher than 1 kWp realized by natural and legal persons, condominiums and public bodies. The decree provided a set of tariffs, valid for a period of 20 years, with a bonus in case of high degree of PV integration in the buildings.  Three types of systems were considered: not integrated, partially integrated and fully integrated. For 2010 the premiums ranged from a minimum of EUR 0.346/kWh (for not integrated plants with P>20 kW) to a maximum of EUR 0.471/kWh (for fully integrated plants with plants a capacity 1=P=3).  A tariff bonus of 5% was provided to self-producers, public schools and public hospitals, installations integrated to building substituting asbestos roofs, municipalities with less than 5 000 inhabitants. Plants with a capacity lower than 20 kWp could further benefit from on the on-spot trading service. Furthermore, this feed-in premium scheme promoted energy efficiency measures in buildings providing an additional bonus in case energy efficiency interventions in the buildings were implemented; on the basis of the energy saving level achieved, it was possible to obtain a maximum increase of the 30% of the base tariff. Producers got, in addition to the premium, the price of the electricity sold either on the market or through bilateral contracts. The feed-in premium scheme for PV plants was again revised by the Ministerial Decree of 6 August 2010. It incentivizes PV plants commissioned after December 31st, 2010, connected to the grid and with a nominal capacity higher than 1 kWp. Natural and legal persons, owners of housing units and/or buildings and public bodies could apply the support scheme. The 2010 decree provided a set of tariffs, valid for a period of 20 years, granted to the following power plants: - Installations on buildings, other PV plants, integrated PV plants with innovative characteristics (i.e. plants that use special components and modules, developed specifically to replace architectural elements); concentrating photovoltaic system; photovoltaic plants with technological innovation (i.e. the one that uses modules and components which are characterized by significant technological innovations). The decree also provides, in addition to a national target for PV power installed by 2020 of 8, 000MW, a power limit for each power plant category that can be incentivized: - 3, 000 MW for photovoltaic plants; - 300 MW for Photovoltaic plants which are architecturally integrated with innovative characteristics; - 200 MW Concentrating photovoltaic system. The provisions set by this last ministerial decree applied to PV plants commissioned until 31.5.2011 as according to the provisions of the Legislative decree No.28/2011. The Ministerial Decree of May 5th, 2011 sets out provisions for promoting PV plants with a capacity = 1 kW and commissioned between June 1st, 2011 and December 31st, 2016. It also establishes a 23,000 MW cap for the national capacity installed which corresponds to an indicative cumulative annual cost of 6-7 billions of euros. Once achieved one of these minimum values set either for the national capacity cap or for the cumulative annual cost, a further Ministerial Decree will be issued to revise the PV support scheme. The decree establishes a set of tariffs differentiated by capacity and category of PV plants, distinguishing between PV on building and \"other\" PV plants. It also provides specific premiums to incentivize the use of photovoltaic modules that use non-conventional and special components, developed specifically to complement architectural elements and replace the buildings, in PV plants with a capacity  =  1 kW and  =  5 MW. May apply to such tariffs natural and legal persons, public entities and owners of houses and/or buildings. Furthermore, the Ministerial Decree introduces a feed-in premium scheme to incentivize Concentrating PV systems. Only legal persons and public entities may apply to such specific tariffs. All the tariffs set by the ministerial decree are granted to electricity produced as a bonus on top of the electricity selling price. As of 1.1.2013, the tariffs will be granted to the electricity injected into the grid modifying the previous feed-in premium scheme in a feed-in tariff scheme.

{"Policy": "Notice regulating the standardization of investment and development of PV plants", "Policy_Content": "The Notice provides a guideline for investment and development plan creation of the PV plant in order to increase efficiency, quality and transparency. 1. Strengthen the planning of photovoltaic power plants. The competent energy departments of the provincial (autonomous region, municipality) governments should organize areas that have the conditions for building photovoltaic power stations, systematically carry out surveys, evaluations, and planning of photovoltaic power station construction conditions, and take overall consideration of solar energy resources, land use, grid access, and market consumption. Reasonably plan the development layout and construction sequence of photovoltaic power stations, and give priority to photovoltaic power station projects that combine poverty alleviation development, ecological protection, pollution control, facility agriculture, and fish farming with comprehensive economic and social benefits.       2. Improve the resource allocation method of photovoltaic power station projects. The competent energy departments of local governments at the provincial level and below should set up corresponding project construction standards and other requirements according to the nature, scale and specific requirements of different photovoltaic power station projects and announce them to the public, and encourage the use of competitive methods such as bidding to allocate project resources and choose Project investment subject. For enterprises that obviously lack corresponding capital, technology and management capabilities, they should not allocate photovoltaic power station projects that are not suitable for their capabilities.       3. Improve the record management of photovoltaic power station projects. The competent energy departments of all provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government) should further improve the record management measures for photovoltaic power station projects, and if they are delegated to local government energy authorities below the provincial level for record management, they should put forward standardized record management requirements. The project filing documents should clearly define the project construction content, investment subject, construction site and external construction conditions and other elements. In view of the short development cycle of photovoltaic power station projects, the validity period of the filing documents and the conditions and procedures for revocation and modification should be clearly stipulated . If construction is not started within the validity period and no extension is applied for as required, the project filing documents will automatically become invalid upon expiration.       4. Stop speculative behavior in the investment and development of photovoltaic power plants. Enterprises that apply for the filing of photovoltaic power station projects should focus on their own (as the controlling party) investment and development, and be able to carry out project construction in a timely manner according to the plan and annual plan. For enterprises whose purpose is not to invest and develop themselves, but to resell project filing documents or illegally transfer to seek improper benefits, energy authorities at all levels should stipulate that they cannot develop photovoltaic power plant projects as investors within a certain period of time. In the preliminary work of photovoltaic power plants, normal technical services and commercial cooperation between enterprises should be carried out in accordance with laws and regulations. For legitimate reasons for project cooperation development and transfer of project assets, government filing documents and related rights and interests cannot be transferred with compensation. Before the project is put into production, the investor of the project that has gone through the filing procedures shall not transfer the project to other investors without the consent of the filing authority. During the implementation of the project, if there is a major change in the investor or the construction location and construction content, an application should be filed with the project filing authority to go through the filing procedures again.       5. Prohibit all kinds of local protection and increase the burden on enterprises. The competent energy departments of local governments at all levels should formulate open, fair and just rules when allocating photovoltaic power station resources, and should not restrict companies that meet the access conditions outside the region for various reasons, and should not force enterprises to purchase photovoltaic cells in the region. Board and other product requirements. In the link of allocation of photovoltaic power station resources and project filing, enterprises shall not be charged any fees other than national laws and regulations, and shall not apportion any expenses unrelated to project construction to enterprises in any form, and implement competitive methods such as bidding to allocate photovoltaic power station resources. , resource usage fees, etc. shall not be used as competition conditions.       6. Seriously deal with violations of laws and regulations in the development of photovoltaic power plants.

Strengthen the implementation and management of the annual plan of photovoltaic power plants. In the fourth quarter, the National Energy Administration organized the compilation of the guidance scale for the construction of photovoltaic power plants in the next year. After the National Energy Administration issued the annual guidance scale for photovoltaic power plants, the energy authorities of each province (autonomous region, city) should determine the photovoltaic power plants included in the scale within one month. Project, specify the project name, construction location, construction capacity and investment subject, and submit relevant project information to the National Energy Administration. All provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities) and city and county energy authorities should supervise and coordinate projects to promptly implement construction conditions such as power grid access and land use. Construction should start in the year of filing and be completed and put into production within the year. If the project confirmed at the beginning of the year still cannot be filed by the end of September, the energy authorities at or below the provincial level may replace the project with other projects of the same capacity.       8. Strengthen the supervision of photovoltaic power station projects. The agencies of the National Energy Administration should strengthen the closed-loop supervision of the entire process of resource allocation, project filing, engineering construction, grid connection, grid-connected operation, full grid connection, electricity price execution, and electricity fee settlement for photovoltaic power station projects. The competent energy departments of all provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government) shall report to the National Energy Administration in a timely manner the implementation of the annual plan for the construction of photovoltaic power plants, project filing and construction progress, and send a copy to the dispatched agencies. The dispatched agencies should regularly inspect the start-up and construction progress of photovoltaic power plants, report the relevant situation to the National Energy Administration in a timely manner, and send a copy to the competent energy department of the province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the Central Government) where it is located. When a local agency discovers illegal activities in resource allocation and project transfer of photovoltaic power plants, it shall report regulatory information to the competent energy department of the province (autonomous region, municipality directly under the Central Government) where it is located, and report to the National Energy Administration.", "law or strategy": "Decisional Notices and Communications", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": "Energy systems", "subsector": "Energy systems:Electricity & heat", "Instrument": "Information Programmes;Government Provision of Public Goods or Services;Regulatory Approaches", "Sector-Instrument": "Regulatory Approaches:Efficiency or environmental performance standards", "objective": NaN, "subobjective": NaN, "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "National"}

{"Policy": "Alternative Fuels for Transport European Union (27) (2001)", "Policy_Content": "COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT, THE COUNCIL, THE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL COMMITTEE AND THE COMMITTEE OF THE REGIONS on alternative fuels for road transportation and on a set of measures to promote the use of biofuels  1. Introduction  Oil production in the EU has been on the increase over the last decade, due to the success of exploration in the North Sea. At the same time oil consumption has remained almost unchanged, primarily due to the phasing-out of oil as an energy source for non-transportation uses, thus compensating for strong growth in transportation oil consumption. In the coming twenty to thirty years EU production is expected to decline, whereas consumption will increase as substitution possibilities will be exhausted and transport demand is likely to continue to grow.  During the coming decades of increased import dependency world oil demand is also expected to show strong growth and the global distribution of known oil reserves leaves the Middle East OPEC members as the only possible suppliers to this increased demand.  In addition, this scenario is out of step with the recognised necessity of reducing global greenhouse gas emissions and particularly with the Kyoto commitments for industrialised countries to initiate their reduction programmes over the coming decade.  This is the backdrop against which the Commission's Green Paper: Towards an European Strategy for the Security of Energy Supply introduces the objective of 20% substitution by alternative fuels in the road transport sector by the year 2020 with the dual purpose of improving security of supply and reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  This objective poses a challenge well beyond what has been asked from the car and oil industry in the past such as drastic reduction of emissions of conventional air pollutants, virtual elimination of lead and sulphur from automotive fuels or significant improvement of fuel efficiency against developments that would otherwise have led to increased fuel consumption.  Any radical changes in fuel supply or engine technology for road transport faces a number of problems. The population at large has got used to having at their disposal a car that has over the years become very cheap as has the fuel (particularly when compared to disposable income). Refuelling is necessary only for every 400-600 km (or more) available everywhere and done in a few minutes. The car serves purposes from short distance shopping by one person in the local supermarket to taking the family on the annual (or semi-annual) holiday to the other end of Europe. In addition virtually no safety restrictions exist for parking or otherwise placing the car in spite of it carrying a large amount of highly flammable liquid. Few people would be ready to compromise much on any of the advantages offered by today's car.  Freight transport has different criteria. As an economic sector subject to strong internal competition, cost and reliability are key factors. Any alternative fuel or engine technology will have to be made competitive in order to penetrate the market. On the other hand, long distance road transport is a single functional activity and refuelling points need not to be as close together as for passenger transport. However, their geographical coverage (throughout Europe) is essential.  The penetration potential for any alternative fuel for the future has to be evaluated against these criteria. Different alternatives will require different types and levels of investment in infrastructure and equipment. Replacing a few percent of diesel or gasoline with biodiesel or ethanol is the simplest, establishing plants to produce such alternative fuels being the only \"long term\" investment. Fuel cells fuelled by hydrogen are the most complicated alternative, requiring alternative engine technology, as well as large investment in plants to produce the hydrogen and a totally new distribution system. Shifting to a hydrogen-based transport system is a major decision, which will only make sense as part of a large-scale, long-term strategy, in principle extending even beyond the EU.  The driving force behind long-term substitution of conventional diesel and gasoline is the need partly to improve the security of energy supply, partly to reduce the environmental impact, especially climate change, from the transport sector. Any long-term solution will, as a minimum, have to offer a reduction in oil dependency and a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, compared to the most fuel-efficient vehicles running on conventional fuel. In addition, it must be required that such alternatives permit a continued reduction in emission of \"conventional\" air pollutants from the vehicles.  The combined requirement of comfort and performance of the car, security of supply of the fuel, low environmental impact and high level of safety and continued low overall cost of driving can in no way be fully met at any time. Future policy development will have to give higher priority to security of energy supply and fuel efficiency (lower greenhouse gas emission). An economic growth rate of 2-3% annually allows sufficient margin for transport cost to increase moderately for those who are not prepared to accept a reduction in car size or performance. This is particularly important in a transition period allowing for a change to a more sustainable transport sector. Penetration of any new transport technology is fundamentally dependent on broad availability of the fuel. Establishing an area covering fuel supply systems is very expensive and only justified if there is a sufficiently high demand, i.e. penetration. This \"chicken and egg\" situation makes any take-off difficult and implies that only on a sufficiently large level such as the EU-wide level is it realistic to imagine the introduction of alternative fuels with significant market shares.  On the basis of the consideration mentioned above the Commission sees three main potential alternative ranges of fuels that could each be developed up to the level of 5% or more of the total automotive fuel market by 2020:  - biofuels  - natural gas  - hydrogen  In addition, the technology of hybrid cars, combining combustion and electric drives, offers a degree of fuel saving comparable to what alternative fuels may offer. These alternative fuels and technology are described below, along with other alternatives that do not look quite so promising yet, but might offer more limited contributions.  The present communication does not set out to deliver the definitive answers to the challenges outlined above. It does, however, try to identify an approach to be followed during the coming years necessary to allow the EU to achieve the medium-term goals of 20% substitution of conventional automotive fuel by 2020 and to do it in a way that sets the direction for the development of road transport systems in the decades following 2020.", "law or strategy": "Decisional Notices and Communications", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": "Transport", "subsector": NaN, "Instrument": "Subsidies;Regulatory Approaches;Government Provision of Public Goods or Services", "Sector-Instrument": NaN, "objective": NaN, "subobjective": NaN, "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "International"}

{"Policy": "Reduced VAT for energy-saving materials", "Policy_Content": "In 1998 the UK Government introduced a reduced value-added tax (VAT) rate of 5% (down from 17.5%) for the grant-funded installation of certain energy-saving materials (ESMs) in the homes of elderly, less well off and vulnerable households. This reduced VAT rate applied to all insulation, draught stripping, hot water, and central heating controls. In Budget 2000, the Government extended this scheme to all households, even if the service is not grant funded. Budget 2000 and 2002 also introduced further reduced VAT rates for ESMs when they are part of grant-funded installations into vulnerable households  including central heating systems, heating appliances, and factory-insulated hot water tanks. The 2004 Budget announced reduced VAT for ground source heat pumps, and the 2005 Budget extended this to air source heat pumps. The 2005 and 2006 Budgets also announced reduced VAT to encourage microgeneration technologies for use by individual households. These include small wind turbines, solar panelsand microcombined heat and power (CHP) units. The 2007 Budget further confirmed this commitment to maintaining reduced VAT for microgeneration technology. Following EU rulings,the Government is consulting on the scope of the reduced rate. It will remain fully available (except on wind and water turbines) for supplies of services of installing energy-saving materials in residential accommodation where the supply is made to a qualifying person (a person who is aged 60 or over or is in receipt of certain benefits) or to a housing association or where the residential accommodation is a building or part of a building used solely for a relevant residential purpose. Otherwise, the reduced rate will be available (except on wind and water turbines) provided that the value of the energy-saving materials does not exceed 60% of the total value of the supply of installing the energy-saving materials.

Japan\u2019s regulation of building energy efficiency falls under the Energy Conservation Law that was first adopted in 1979.  Subsequently amended several times, the last major revision was in 1999. There are separate regulations for \u201cbuildings,\u201d i.e., commercial buildings, and \u201chouses,\u201d i.e., residential buildings.  Beyond regulations, Japan has also fostered a number of non-regulatory programs to promote building energy efficiency, including an Energy Efficiency Center of Japan (ECCJ), the CASBEE rating system for green buildings, and a four-level ranking system for housing performance. In the two and a half decades since energy conservation was identified as a high priority for the government, Japan has established a multi-tiered system for promoting building energy efficiency.    Japan\u2019s building energy regulations are part of the national Energy Conservation Law that was first adopted in 1979. Within the Energy Conservation Law, there are several sections that apply to the building sector, including Criteria for Clients on the Rationalization of Energy Use for Buildings, and the Design and Construction Guidelines on the Rationalization of Energy Use for Houses. The first applies to non-residential and the second to residential buildings. Although these standards are defined as voluntary, there are numerous aspects that are enforceable. For example, building owners are obligated to submit a report on energy conservation measures prior to new construction, extension, alteration, as well as major renovations, which must be reviewed and approved. Furthermore, in 2002 this reporting for \u201cbuildings\u201d, i.e., commercial buildings, was made mandatory. The government is also planning to make both standards mandatory in 2007. In the Kyoto implementation plan, the Japanese government projects that energy codes will save $5.3 billion per year while avoiding annual 34.0 million metric tons of CO2 emissions by 2010. Government statistics have indicated that the compliance rate has been growing in recent years, increasing from 13 percent in 2000 to 32 percent in 2004 for residential buildings, and from 34 percent in 1999 to 74 percent in 2004 for commercial buildings. After the standards are made mandatory, compliance is expected to exceed 80 percent. Scope. The commercial standard for non-residential commercial buildings was first adopted in 1979, and the residential standard, in 1980, as parts of Japan\u2019s national Energy Conservation Law.

In developing the energy policy framework, Government is mindful of the critical role of the energy sector in the attainment of its overall socio-economic development goals of improving the livelihood of all its peoples. vision  \u201cBy the year 2020 guided by the principles in the \u201cTe Kakeega II\u201d and the \u201cMalefatunga Declaration\u201d, Tuvalu shall attain a prosperous living standard that is fostered through an energy policy that promotes the provision of socially, financially, economically, technically, politically and environmentally sustainable energy systems and within the framework of the Tuvalu Initial National Communication under the United Nations Framework on Climate Change (Oct 1999)\u201d. goal To improve the well-being of the Tuvalu people by promoting the use of its renewable energy resources and implementing cost effective, equitable, reliable, accessible, affordable, secure and environmentally sustainable energy systems. The TNEP is developed with six (6) guiding principles namely: sustainability, gender equity, environment compatibility, stakeholder participation, good governance, and cultural and traditional compatibility which are presented below. (i) Sustainability The broader outlook of energy effectively contributing to sustainable development provides one of the key principles in developing the TNEP. The TNEP will provide the guidance and necessary ingredients to provide sustainable energy services. Affordability is a significant component to access energy services and Government is mindful of this with respect to the different level of income of communities. It is with the intention that TNEP will provide the framework that would enable the various communities provide for their energy needs. (ii) Gender Equity Government is mindful of the needs of different gender groups and levels of development pertaining to the different communities. The distinct needs of men, women, children and social groups will be taken into consideration in any energy development activities. Attention shall be given to ensure that energy programmes that are developed and implemented strike a balance between social and economic development needs of the population. (iii) Environment Compatibility The fragile atoll environment and increasing trends of energy consumption is noteworthy. It is therefore intended that all energy initiatives will need to seriously consider environmental issues and in particular the impact of energy production, storage, transmission and distribution on land, water and air. Any proposed energy development will require an environmental impact assessment. It is with anticipation that the negative impacts on the fragile environment can be lessened through the consideration of the principles of environmental compatibility and implementation of climate change mitigation programmes in the energy sector planning and development. (iv) Stakeholder Participation A wide range of stakeholders were consulted individually and in a workshop setting to identify and formulate national energy priority issues. The consultative process has not been much greater then now and is a prerequisite for any formulation of any national framework. (v) Good Governance This embraces best practices for the effective, efficient and economic delivery of energy services. It also includes the welfare of vulnerable groups through the application of appropriate energy technologies. (vi) Cultural and Traditional Compatibility Energy services to enhance and add value to the traditional family and community lifestyles play a significant role in the socio-economic development of Tuvalu.", "law or strategy": "Preparatory Instruments", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": "Energy systems", "subsector": "Energy systems:Electricity & heat", "Instrument": "Government Provision of Public Goods or Services", "Sector-Instrument": NaN, "objective": "Social", "subobjective": "Social:Gender impact;Social:Energy/mobility access", "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "National"}

These, in turn, need to be defined in an Action Plan to be prepared following the approval of the PNE 2050. The document notably prioritises the expansion of hydropower capacity, of oil and gas production, the analysis of promotion mechanisms for a range of renewables, research and development, and increased efficiency.<br><br>The PNE 2030 is the first study of integrated planning of energy resources held within the Brazilian government, and prepared by the Ministry of Mines and Energy of Brazil (MME). It proposes a strategic direction for expansion of energy supply. Its estimate of future electricity needs is based on a forecast percentage growth in demand per annum corresponding to an average GDP growth per annum. The PNE is composed of a series of studies that seek to provide inputs to formulate energy policies according to an integrated view of available resources. As a contribution to meeting that future estimated demand, the MME proposes 164GW as the country's \u2018exploitable, but as yet unrealised' hydropower \u2018potential'. Of that 164GW, the MME says that 90% (about 147GW) is in the Amazon region.

{"Policy": "Air Quality Standards United States of America (2013)", "Policy_Content": "HISTORY Ambient air quality on the federal level is regulated by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). US federal legislation on air quality began with the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 and the Clean Air Act (CAA) in 1963. In 1967, the Air Quality Act expanded federal activities and initiated extensive ambient monitoring studies. In 1970, a landmark shift took place with the amendment of the original Clean Air Act, including the establishment of National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) and State Implementation Plans (SIPs). Enforcement authority was also expanded. More stringent permit review requirements were established in 1977.  On a State level, environmental agencies with air divisions are responsible for regional air quality and for creating and carrying out mandated SIPs within three years of the promulgation of a NAAQS. Under its most recent amendment in 1990, the CAA requires EPA to set NAAQS for all pollutants considered harmful to public health and the environment. In 1997, EPA established the first annual and 24-hour NAAQS for a new criteria pollutant category, PM2.5.  TECHNICAL STANDARDS Carbon monoxide (CO), lead (Pb), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), particulate pollution (PM10 and PM2.5), and sulfur dioxide (SO2) are known as \u201ccriteria pollutants.\u201d The EPA sets both primary standards (designed to protect public health) and secondary standards (designed to protect public welfare including visibility, crops, buildings, etc.)  EPA\u2019s latest scheduled 5-year review of the NAAQS is to be completed in 2013.

The DME, in close collaboration with all the sector players (in particular the manufacturers), has decided to start the labelling initiative with the labelling of refrigerators. The refrigerator was chosen as most electrified households typically purchase a refrigerator as the first electrical kitchen appliance. Labelled appliances were in the shops as from late March 2004, and towards August 2005 labelled refrigerators were all over South Africa \u2013 even in the smallest town. Parallel to household refrigerators the DME also ensures and supports the labelling of household freezers.   The standards for refrigerators have been adopted from the European Market. This enables products to flow freely between the continents without having to be re-tested . It also ensures that identical products carry the same grading even in different countries.

{"Policy": "Sri Lanka Energy Sector Development Plan for a Knowledge-based Economy 2015-2025", "Policy_Content": "Strategies include reducing the carbon footprint of energy sector to address global warming and climate change impacts. Emphasis on renewables and energy efficiency. Sri Lanka is on the path towards becoming an internationally competitive middle-income country. This power and energy sector development plan is aligned to the country\u2019s development drive, and has been prepared to provide affordable, high quality and reliable energy for all citizens, rich or poor, equally by conserving country\u2019s precious natural environment, giving priority to the indigenous energy sources, and minimizing regional disparities in energy service delivery. The power and energy sector vision is to capture the full potential of all renewable and other indigenous resources in order for Sri Lanka to become a nation self-sufficient in energy. The total energy requirement of the country was around 11,125 ktoe in 2013, and the primary energy supply mainly consisted of 4,814 ktoe of biomass, 4,582 ktoe of fossil fuels, and 1,442 ktoe of hydro. Accordingly, 56% of total energy consumption is from indigenous (biomass + hydro), and Sri Lanka has to import fossil fuels to meet the balance. This requires importing 02 MMT of crude oil, 04 MMT of refined petroleum products and 2.25 MMT of coal to the country annually, costing approximately USD 5 billion in foreign exchange. The average annual total Ministry of Power & Energy bill of imported fossil fuel is therefore 25% of our import expenditure, and nearly 50% of total export income. Therefore the power and energy sector has a huge bearing on the country\u2019s balance of trade and exchange rates. Sri Lanka has already achieved a grid connectivity of 98%, which is commendable by South Asian standards. Current total installed power generation capacity of the country is approximately 4,050 MW, consisting of 900 MW of coal power, 1,335 MW of oil burning thermal power, 1,375 MW of hydro power and 442 MW of non-conventional renewable energy sources such as wind, mini hydro, biomass and solar power plants. The annual total electricity demand is about 10,500 GWh, comprising of 38% from domestic consumers, 39% from industries and 20% from commercial enterprises, with the balance coming from other sectors such as religious organizations and street lighting. The overall annual demand for electricity is expected to increase by around    constrained by high prices. 4-6 %, a number The annual total electricity demand is about 10,500 GWh, comprising of 38% from domestic consumers, 39% from industries and 20% from commercial enterprises, with the balance coming from other sectors such as religious organizations and street lighting. The transport sector is also an important pillar of the economy. A sustainable transportation system contributes towards better socio-economic development by increasing rural connectivity and sustaining an efficient and clean urban environment. As shown by studies conducted in the recent past, the transport sector is the highest contributor to  GHG emissions with a share of about 48% of all CO2 emitted from fossil fuel combustion. In 2013, out of a 5.2 million total vehicle fleet, the number of two wheeled and three wheeled vehicles was 3.6 million, which is expected to increase with higher economic development, posing both financial and environmental challenges in the future. In this context, it is clear that a strategic balance between the national energy demand and supply has to be maintained with a long term perspective, in order to support a steady economic growth in Sri Lanka. With one of Sri Lanka\u2019s primary resources being her human capital, this sector development plan for a knowledge based economy has primarily developed to meet energy demand through renewable and other indigenous energy resources, and their potentials towards a \u201cgreen\u201d economy, energy conservation measures for its sustainability, measures for energy security, financially and economically justifiable pricing policies for electricity and petroleum products, research and development initiatives, and importantly management and good governance practices for the sector. These initiatives will ensure that consumers and businesses are not unduly vulnerable to external market factors, and that the economy can benefit from a secure and affordable energy supply.  Sri Lanka will be elevated to a regional hub by increasing its refinery capacity and utilizing the gas and condensate discoveries in the Mannar basin to create and meet domestic demand as well as to supply international oil and gas markets.  Development of a natural gas processing plant in Norochcholai and an oil storage and trading centre using the Trincomalee tank farm are part of this strategy. Large scale deployment of renewable energy will further increase the resilience of Sri Lanka\u2019s energy supply, with a large scale wind farm in Mannar and a wide spread network of fuel wood exchanges being some planned Green initiatives.  The power and energy sector of Sri Lanka is looking forward to an energy self-sufficient nation by 2030. 1)  To make Sri Lanka an energy self-sufficient nation by 2030  i)  Increase the share of electricity generation from renewable energy sources from 50% in 2014 to 60% by 2020 and finally to meet the total demand from renewable and other indigenousenergy resources by 2030.

{"Policy": "National System for Energy and Indoor Air Quality Certification of Buildings (SCE)", "Policy_Content": "The buildings certification system in Portugal operates in conjunction with two sets of building regulations applied to construction, the Regulations on Thermal Behaviour of Buildings (RCCTE) and the Regulations on HVAC Systems in Buildings (RSECE), fully transposing the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD). The SCE, which entered into force on 1 July 2007, aims to save energy and protect the environment. The timetable for implementation of the SCE is divided into three phases with full implementation in January 2009 at which time all contracted buildings will be included: new houses, sales and leases. In the first phase, the legislation only covers new buildings designed for housing or services with a floor area measuring more than 1,000m2 and whose licensing and construction permit applications are submitted from the first of the month. The second phase, which comes into force on 1 July 2008, includes all licensing applications for buildings regardless of their floor area. A key aspect of the SCE is the Energy Certificate. This document will assign an energy performance label to residential and service buildings and list measures for improving the energy performance of these properties, thus increasing energy savings by 20 to 40% and reducing subsequent CO2 emissions. The energy label allows the residential or service units to be classified on an efficiency scale ranging from A+ (high energy efficiency) to G (poor efficiency). This is similar to the scale used for some domestic equipment and appliances and allows for easy reading and interpretation by the consumer. The cost of issuing a certificate by a qualified expert varies according to building type and complexity. Its registration is subject to the payment of a variable charge based on the propertys use. As of July 2007, all non-residential buildings required an Energy Certificate. As of 1 July 2008, this applies to all new buildings, which must obtain a at least a B classification. All buildings will require certification from January 1 2009. The SCE also involves a management support system, in the form of a website, which provides information on the certification process and an advertising campaign \"Lets save energy to save Portugal\".

{"Policy": "Residential Mass Rollout Programme (RMR)", "Policy_Content": "Eskom introduced the RMR programme to overcome this challenge by distributing and installing specific pre-approved electricity saving technologies to the residential sector. For this undertaking special installation contractors were selected. Contractors had to be in a robust financial position in order to cover installation works upfront and they had to officially register with Eskom.  Such companies were responsible for advertising the programme in certain areas and, if households showed interest in new energy saving technologies, companies would carry out the exchange of equipment guaranteeing the proper installation. Energy savings were ensured by the installation of pre-approved technologies. Companies had to document and report their work to Eskom and were, then, reimbursed by the utility.  The technologies which were included in the programme were compact fluorescent lightbulbs, LED downlighters, electric hot water heater insulation blankets, aerated shower heads, load control devises, and pool and/or electric hot water heater timers. Targeted households could participate in the programme at no cost (free issue) but the distributed items were limited to specific products published on a list. For RMR products, where national standards existed these would have to be met, for technology where national standards did not exist, such as LED lights, Eskom would specify minimum requirements and undertake random sampling to confirm and maintain quality. To reduce costs, the vendors would target specific neighbourhoods, having communicated in the press and other media, and go door to door offering to exchange inefficient for efficient technology. Each phase typically ran for six months and targeted 200,000 to 300,000 households.  The programme operated in phases, whereby Eskom would put out a Request for Proposal (RfP) for vendors (installers) to submit proposals. Appointed companies could use the RMR-contract to secure funding from financial institutions to pay for products and installation works upfront. Vendors had to demonstrate that the technology met certain minimum performance standards and that their pricing was market related. Priority was given to small black owned enterprises (Polity, 2012). The RMR programme had an overall budget of R1.5 billion (EUR 120 million) and was funded from the overall Eskom \u201cIntegrated Demand Side Management Programme (IDM). M&V was conducted by the Eskom audit team and vendors were required to submit documentation, remove inefficient appliances from household for Eskom to inspect on request and conduct random spot checks.

The scheme paid  - without income restriction  - one-third of the cost of installing ceiling and under-floor insulation up to a maximum of NZ$1,300. People on lower incomes were eligible for up to 60 per cent of the total cost of insulation and NZ$1,200 towards a clean heating appliance, provided the home was first insulated. Landlords whose tenants were low-income earners could also receive the 60 per cent subsidy.  The programme operated on a co-funding basis with four sets of partners: local government, iwi, existing and new service providers, and energy retailers. Generally this third-party funding was applied to low-income households to cover the remaining 40 per cent of the costs of insulation not provided by the programme.  In Budget 2009 the Government allocated the programme NZ$323 million over 4 years. The initial aim was to retrofit over 180,000 homes. In November 2009 the Government announced that the programme would be enhanced by an additional NZ$24 million of funding targeted at low-income families, allowing an additional 8000 households to benefit.

Totalling EUR 2.45 billion of credits,  this initiative is part of the EUR 35 billion Investments for the Future (PIA) programme.  The programme is already demonstrating  its ability to unite companies and research  partners, and to stimulate their innovationcapabilities. Compared to other existing  national research programmes, this new  programme aims at bringing innovation to the  market and focuses on specific fields set up by  strategic roadmaps. Specific fields eligible for funding include: (i) renewable energy and green chemistry (EUR 1.1 billion): development of new  technologies in decarbonised energy (e.g. solar,  wind), bioresources, low-carbon buildings,  energy storage and carbon capture and storage  (CCS);(ii) smart grids (EUR 165 million): research and testing in real conditions  to enable the integration of intermittent  renewable energies into electrical grids and to  promote  smart services \u20ac\u009d that improve energy  demand management;(iii) circular economy (EUR 210 million): demonstration plants and  circular economy industries, including waste  management, soil and sediment remediation,  ecodesign and industrial ecology; and(iv) lowcarbon vehicles (EUR 950 million): development  of innovative technologies and solutions  focused on land and sea transportation. To manage these projects, ADEME developed specific financial tools, bearing in mind the  public objectives of job creation, activity  development in the French territory, economic  competitiveness and environmental benefits:  (i) state aids complying with European Union regulations on competition. This type of  support, the most widely used, consists of  refundable grants, where the return mechanism  is correlated to the project success, and of  traditional (non-refundable) grants, mostly  dedicated to research laboratories and smalland  medium-sized enterprises (SMEs); and(ii) equity investment tools, where the state plays  the role of market investor, one for SME projects  and one for intermediate-sized and large  enterprise projects.  The first 115 selected projects represent  investments of more than EUR 3 billion,  supported with EUR 940 million from the  programme to date.

{"Policy": "The Petroleum Licensing (Production) (Seaward Areas) Regulations 2008", "Policy_Content": "The Regulations were passed for the Petroleum Act 1998 and prescribe the model clauses to be incorporated in petroleum production licences for offshore areas. They were amended by the Petroleum and Offshore Gas Storage and Unloading Licensing (Amendment) Regulations 2017(Effective Date: 15 September, 2017). The Oil and Gas Authority (OGA), where necessary, may modify or exclude them in particular cases.Under clause 2, the Oil and Gas Authority (created under the Energy Act of 2016) grants to the licensee exclusive licence to explore for and exploit petroleum in the offshore area. The OGA, however, retains the right to grant a methane drainage licence in respect of the whole or any part of the licensed area. Furthermore, the licence does not affect the exercise of any rights granted under any such methane drainage licence.Clause 23 provides for avoidance of harmful methods of working. For example, under clause 23(1), the licensee is required to maintain all apparatus and appliances and all wells in the licensed area in good repair and condition. Furthermore, they must execute all operations in a proper and workmanlike manner in accordance with methods and practice customarily used in good oilfield practice, for instance, to control the flow and to prevent the escape or waste of petroleum discovered in or obtained from the licensed area.Clause 23(3) prohibits flaring and venting of any gas except with the consent in writing of the OGA and in accordance with the conditions, if any, of the consent. The application for consent must be made in writing to the OGA and must specify the date on which the licensee proposes to begin the flaring or venting. Clause 23(6) grants the licensee a right of hearing (about the technical and financial factors) before the OGA can decide to withhold consent or to grant it subject to conditions.Under clause 23(7), consent shall not be required for any flaring which, in consequence of an event which the licensee did not foresee in time to deal with it otherwise than by flaring, is necessary in order to remove or reduce the risk of injury to persons in the vicinity of the well in question; or to maintain a flow of petroleum from that or any other well. However, the licensee must inform the OGA of any flaring or venting and, in case of the flaring is being conducted to maintain a flow of petroleum, stop that flaring upon request from the competent authority.The model clauses also require the licensee to notify the OGA of any event causing the escape or waste of Petroleum. Furthermore, they must set up security of funds be able to discharge any liability for damage attributable to the release or escape of petroleum, as may be required.Other clauses relate to the inspection of records, furnishing of information and rights of access to the licensee's installations or equipment for purposes of examination and enforcement, as well as power to require the plugging and abandonment of a suspended well.", "law or strategy": "Regulation/Directive/Decision", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": NaN, "subsector": NaN, "Instrument": "Information Programmes;Government Provision of Public Goods or Services;Regulatory Approaches", "Sector-Instrument": NaN, "objective": "Environmental", "subobjective": "Environmental:Ecosystem impact", "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "National"}
{"Policy": "Clean Energy for All Europeans Package European Union (27) (2019)", "Policy_Content": "Overarching policy encompassing 8 legislative acts with the goal to update the energy policy framework of the EU and deliver on the EU's Paris Agreement commitments for reducing GHGs emissions. Binding targets: 32% of renewable energy sources in the EU's energy mix by 2030; 32.5% energy efficiency by 2030 minimum. In 2019 the EU overhauled its energy policy framework to help us move away from fossil fuels towards cleaner energy - and, more specifically, to deliver on the EU\u2019s Paris Agreement commitments for reducing greenhouse gas emissions.  The agreement on this new energy rulebook \u2013 called the Clean energy for all Europeans package \u2013 marked a significant step towards implementing the energy union strategy, published in 2015.  Based on Commission proposals published in 2016, the package consists of 8 new laws. Following political agreement by the EU Council and the European Parliament (finalised in May 2019) and the entry into force of the different EU rules, EU countries have 1-2 years to convert the new directives into national law.  The new rules will bring considerable benefits for consumers, the environment, and for the economy. By coordinating these changes at EU level, the legislation also underlines EU leadership in tackling global warming and makes an important contribution to the EU\u2019s long-term strategy of achieving carbon neutrality (net-zero emissions) by 2050.", "law or strategy": "Law/Act", "Policy Type": "executive", "sector": "Multi-sector;Energy systems", "subsector": "Energy systems:Electricity & heat", "Instrument": "Government Provision of Public Goods or Services", "Sector-Instrument": NaN, "objective": NaN, "subobjective": NaN, "Jurisdiction_standard_amend": "International"}
