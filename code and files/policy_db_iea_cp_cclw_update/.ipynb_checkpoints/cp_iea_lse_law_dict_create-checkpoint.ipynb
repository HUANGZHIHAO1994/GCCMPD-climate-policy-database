It consists of the judgments of courts, and is also referred to as ***case law***. This can be a judgment to interpret the wording of statute law, to protect the principles of natural justice, to fill a gap in the law, or to deal with an unforeseen situation not covered by statute. The common law consists of written decisions (not a codification or summary of the judgments) and the judgments may be cited in subsequent litigation, when other courts may approve of, follow, or distinguish the original judgment. These later judgments modify the common law (Clegg M, Ellena K, Ennis D, et al., 2016)."

    "- This is a **fundamental difference** from the instruments that can be characterised as 'steering instruments', as these instruments lay down rules that are **not necessarily linked to the existing legal framework** in such a way (Senden L, 2004 P156).   \n",
    "- Steering instruments may lay down new rules, independently of an existing legal framework, or may be adopted in the context of such a framework, **prior to, simultaneous with or subsequent to legislation** (Senden L, 2004 P157).   \n",
    "- Generally, however, they do not confine themselves to the application or explanation of this legislation, but rather **entail an addition to the contents of existing acts** (Senden L, 2004 P157).   \n",

    "- Treaty does not provide for any (legislative) harmonisation activity in that particular area. This seems to be the case especially as regards **recommendations** adopted in areas such as social policy, environmental policy or consumer policy (Senden L, 2004 P166).  \n",
    "- Recommendations that aim at harmonisation go further in that they aim at **aligning national legislative and administrative provisions** (Senden L, 2004 P166).  \n",
    "- One reason for not proposing legislation lies in the **flexible nature of recommendations**; they allow for a more rapid adaptation of rules to new technological developments than legislation. A second reason may lie in considerations of subsidiarity and proportionality, albeit the Commission does not often state this explicitly. A third possibility is that the chosen legal basis limits the choice of instrument and excludes the adoption of legislation (Senden L, 2004 P168-169).  \n",
    "- Sometimes, such recommendations lay down rules that are merely intended to be temporary substitutes for legislative rules, which will in all cases be replaced by legislative rules. These are possibly already in the pipeline at the time of the recommendations’ adoption. These recommendations can be said to fulfil a **temporary para-law function** (Senden L, 2004 P169).  \n",
    "- In the cases where it is established that there is in fact no desire, need or room for legislation, it can be argued that the recommendations are truly intended to fulfil a **permanent para-law function** (Senden L, 2004 P170).  \n",
    "- It is not always easy to separate the different functions and it may very well be that different functions can be identified in one and the same recommendation. Thus, **all three functions** can be considered present in those recommendations in which the Council is of the opinion that Community action should not only be continued but also intensified. It may be **more a question of emphasis as to which function is most apparent** (Senden L, 2004 P182).  \n",
    "- From this it can be inferred that Commission **opinions** mostly fulfil two functions, that is the pre-law and post-law functions. A major **difference between the recommendation and the opinion**, and their respective use in practice, thus appears to be that the opinion cannot be said to fulfil the para-law function, and it is not used as an alternative to legislation (Senden L, 2004 P188).

    "- Puissochet has held that **Non-formal steering instruments** are in particular instruments that express **more a political engagement** than a legal one and non legally binding acts that can differ as to form, contents and the intention of the parties (Senden L, 2004 P190).  \n",
    "- Thus, more in general, **conclusions** can be typified as **political statements** expressing some common agreement on future Community action (Senden L, 2004 P195).  \n",
    "- In other words, it appears that most Council **conclusions** fit more within the process of preparation and elaboration of future Community action, rather than constituting Community (soft) law rules in their own right. The most important function of Council conclusions can therefore be said to be the **pre-law function** (Senden L, 2004 P196).  "

    "- As such, **declarations** are rather **similar to Council conclusions** (Senden L, 2004 P198).   \n",
    "- The **declarations of a declaratory and requesting nature** can also be said to fulfil the **pre-law function**, insofar as they are adopted with a view to the elaboration of further Community action. The so-called **interpretative declarations** can be said to fulfil both the **pre-law and the post-law function** (Senden L, 2004 P199)."

    "- Council **resolutions** thus contain considerations of — at least — two kinds. **Firstly**, they usually start with considerations expressing opinions, acknowledgements, recognitions, confirmations of certain views or considerations **stressing the need or desirability of certain actions**. This is emphasised not only by using verbs of this kind, but often also by putting them in capitals. **Secondly**, resolutions **call upon their addressees to undertake or continue certain actions**, the contents of which are determined by the previously expressed views of the Council (Senden L, 2004 P204).  \n",
    "- **The purposes resolutions** aim at are twofold. **On the one hand**, they may, like Council conclusions and declarations, involve a political acceptance of starting points and principles for future Community action, which to a certain extent at least have already been laid down by the Commission in the form of action programmes or are to be followed by such programmes. **On the other hand**, when it is evident what action is to be taken, resolutions are adopted specifying this action and inviting usually the Member States to take the indicated measures (Senden L, 2004 P206).   \n",
    "- Council **resolutions** can be said to fulfil one or more of the identified functions, but it is their **pre-law function** that has been emphasised most in legal writing (Senden L, 2004 P208). \n",
    "- The **pre-law function** is indeed most evident in the **resolutions** that concern the **establishment or proposed elaboration of action programmes**. Thus, the **para-law function** is clearly apparent in those resolutions to which **an annex has been attached**, setting out precise rules that the addressees are called upon to apply. The **post-law function** is most clearly expressed by the resolutions that are linked to a legislative act, and adopted with a view to the implementation and application of the requirements laid down therein (Senden L, 2004 P208-209).   \n",
    "- A significant **difference** from Council **recommendations** is that, generally speaking, Council **resolutions** only **rarely** mention a specific EC provision as a possible legal basis and only occasionally refer to the EC Treaty as such (Senden L, 2004 P209)."

    "- Their very designation already implies that **codes of conduct** aim at laying down rules of conduct, which are naturally intended to **influence the behaviour of their addressees**. This also becomes clear from the use of terms such as the establishment of ‘principles’, ‘criteria’, ‘standards’ and ‘recommendations’, to be adopted or applied by the addressees. As such, they are of a **normative nature** (Senden L, 2004 P211).   \n",
    "- Sometimes, **codes of conduct** indicate in so many words that they do **not have legally binding force**. Clearly, the absence of legally binding force has to be taken as a starting point for both Commission and Council codes of conduct (Senden L, 2004 P212).  \n",
    "- The foregoing shows that the **code of conduct**, if adopted solely under that designation, is considered to involve **more a political engagement** than a legally binding one (Senden L, 2004 P213).  \n",
    "- As regards the functions underlying **codes of conduct**, it can be observed that those of an external and general nature are often intended to function as an (at least temporary) **alternative to legislation**. As such, they can be regarded as fulfilling the **para-law function** (Senden L, 2004 P214).   \n",
    "- As such, it can be considered to fulfil the **post-law function** and to resemble in fact interpretative communications. Codes of a general and external nature may also be considered to fulfil the **pre-law function** (Senden L, 2004 P215).  "
