Loi nº 98-05 portant Code pétrolier.,1998.0,Senegal,"Le présent code prévoit la possibilité pour les compagnies pétrolières de bénéficier d’une période de rétention de huit ans pour le gaz et de trois ans pour le pétrole brut pour les découvertes qui ne sont pas immédiatement exploitables commercialement, à la différence du Code pétrolier de 1986 qui exige que l’opérateur renonce aux découvertes non commerciales à l’expiration de la période d’exploration. L’autorisation d’exploitation provisoire des hydrocarbures qui était au niveau du décret est introduite dans le code pour permettre aux titulaires d’un permis de recherche d’exploiter à titre provisoire les puits productifs pendant une période maximale de deux ans, période pendant laquelle ils sont tenus de poursuivre la délimitation et le développement du gisement ainsi découvert. Les hydrocarbures gazeux sont traités en tenant compte du fait que leur développement peut nécessiter des investissements et des durées plus longs que ceux des hydrocarbures liquides. En outre, dans le présent Code pétrolier, la durée de validité de la concession de vingt cinq ans peut être prorogée d’une période de dix (10) ans renouvelable une fois, au lieu d’une extension d’une durée maximale de dix (10) ans dans le code de 1986.

Loi nº 98-03 portant le code forestier.,1998.0,Senegal,"La présente loi se substitue à la partie législative du Code forestier du 4 février 1993. Le code de 1993 encourageait déja la foresterie communautaire et l'initiative privée. Il prévoyait la possibilité de concéder gratuitement une forêt de l'Etat à une collectivité locale, qui la gèrait alors à son seul profit, suivant un plan d'aménagement établi par le service forestier. Il accordait en outre aux collectivités locales une ristourne d'une partie des ressources du Fonds forestier national, issue des redevances et des adjudications de coupes. La loi reconnaissait par ailleurs la propriété privée des plantations forestières réalisées par les particuliers, mais sans leur concéder la propriété du sol ainsi planté. De plus, elle leur faisait obligation de gérer rationnellement ces plantations et de procéder à leur reboisement. Suite à la réforme institutionnelle portant la décentralisation des pouvoirs, et notamment, au code des collectivités locales qui érige la région en collectivité locale et à la loi nº 96-07 qui transfère aux régions, aux communes et aux communautés rurales d'importantes compétences en matière forestière, une modification du code forestier s'est avverée nécessaire. Ainsi la politique forestière nationale est précisée par des directives nationales d'aménagement, complétées au Niveau de la région par des orientations forestières régionales. Les collectivités locales ont désormais le pouvoir de gestion sur les forêts situées hors du domaine forestier de l'Etat et peuvent aussi se voir confier par l'Etat, sur la base d'un protocole d'accord, la gestion d'une partie du domaine forestier de l'Etat même. Les collectivités locales peuvent paser des contrats avec des personnes physiques ou morales sur le domaine forestier dont elles ont la gestion et peuvent récruter directement les agents forestiers pour la surveillance des forêts relevant de leur copétence. Mis à part ces apports originaux, la nouvelle loi reste assez proche de celle qu'elle abroge, notamment en ce que la majeure partie de ses dispositions est d'ordre répressif. Elle est formée par 79 articles répartis en 4 titres, à savoir: De la mise en valeur des forêts (I); Répression des infractions (II); Service des eaux et forêts (III); Dispositions diversess (IV).¦ Le premier titre comporte deux chapitres consacrés d'une part aux droits d'exploitation, de l'autre aux droits d'usage. Le second titre détermine, en deux chapitres, la procédure à suivre (en matière de recherche et de constatation, d'actions et de poursuites, de transactions, de saisies et de confiscations) et les sanctions applicables aux différentes infractions. Enfin, le troisième titre traite, en trois chapitres, du rôle, de la protection, des obligations et des pouvoirs des agents des eaux et forêts dans le domaine de la police forestière. Pour les besoins de leur mise en oeuvre, plusieurs dispositions de la loi devront être complétées par un décret d'application, qui constituera la partie réglementaire du Code Forestier.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/loi-no-98-03-portant-le-code-forestier-lex-faoc016268/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3206,Forestry, Legislation,"Framework law,Timber extraction/logging,Public forest,Concession,Private forest,Special fund,Policy/planning,Offences/penalties,Forest service/forest officers,Community management,Forest management/forest conservation","Africa, AFRICA FAO, Least Developed Countries, North Atlantic, Sahel, Western Africa",,ECOLEX_Legislation
