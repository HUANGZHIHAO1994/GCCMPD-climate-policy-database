The exemption is in respect of disposals of waste material that has resulted from certain land reclamations. Article 3 provides for the insertion in the Act of new sections 43A and 43B. The first of these provides an exemption from landfill tax for disposals of waste arising from land for which a certificate, issued by the Commissioners of Customs and Excise under section 43B, is in force. Certain other conditions must be fulfilled. Subsection (3) defines when the qualifying period expires, and this prevents the exemption from applying after, for example, the intended construction of a building has commenced. Subsection (4) prevents the exemption applying if the removal of the waste material is required by certain remediation notices, except where it is undertaken by the public bodies named in subsection (5). Section 43B details the circumstances in which the Commissioners will issue, amend, withdraw or refuse to issue a certificate and lists examples of the conditions which may be attached to the issue of a certificate.

Loi nº 014/96/ADP portant réorganisation agraire et foncière au Burkina Faso.,1996.0,Burkina Faso,"Cette loi détermine les principes fondamentaux de l'aménagement du territoire, de la gestion des terres rurales et urbaines, du régime de l'eau, des forêts, de la faune, de la pêche, des substances de carrière et des mines, ainsi que la réglementation des droits réels immobiliers. Elle est formée par 248 articles répartis en 7 titres, à savoir: Champ d'application (I); Création et définition du domaine foncier national (II); Aménagement du territoire (III); Gestion du domaine foncier national (IV); Réglementation des droits réels immobiliers (V); terres du domaines foncier national situées à l'étranger (VI); Dispositions finales (VII). Le domaine foncier national est constitué de toutes les terres et des biens immeubles ou assimilés cités à l'article 34 de la loi. L'aménagement du territoire doit tenir compte des contraintes et de potentialités du milieu naturel, des capacités humaines et techniques, des nécessités économiques et sociales, des interactions et des spécificités socio-économiques régionales et de la protection de l'environnement. L'aménagement distingue les zones urbaines et celles rurales et se fait sur la base de quatre types de schéma: national, régional, provincial et schéma directeur d'aménagement, chacun de ces schéma étant élaboré par une spécifique commission. Tout changement de destination de terrain doit être approuvé par un décret pris en conseil des ministres. Tout aménagement doit être précédé par une étude d'impact sur l'environnement. L'article 34 arrête la liste des biens immeubles du domaine foncier national qui, en raison de leur nature, de leur destination et de leur affectation , bénéficient de mesures particulières de gestion et de protection. Ces biens sont inaliénables, imprescriptibles et insaisissables et grèvent les fonds riverains de servitudes d'utilité publique. Les articles de 38 à 40 fixent les critères pour la délimitation et la gestion des terres urbaines et rurales, qui sont gérées par les structures suivantes: la commission d'attribution des terres destinées à l'habitation, la commission d'évaluation et de constat de mise en valeur des terres, la commission de retrait des terres. Dans les villages, l'attribution, l'évaluation et le retrait des terres relèvent de la compétence de commissions villageoises de gestion des terroirs organisées en sous-commissions spécialisées. Les articles de 48 à 61 réglementent les titres de jouissance des terres, toujours nécessaires à l'exception des cas d'occupation et d'exploitation des terres rurales non aménagées dans le but de subvenir aux besoins de logement et de nourriture de l'occupant et de sa famille. La délivrance des titres est subordonnée à la mise en valeur des terres et au paiement des droits et des taxes dus. Les terres urbaines destinées à l'habitation sont attribuées de gré en gré, et dans certaines zones bien définies, par adjudication. Les articles de 66 à 70 réglementent l'aliénation des terres du domaine foncier national, normalement subordonnée à l'obtention préalable d'un permis et à des conditions particulières de mises en valeurs.

Loi nº 137 sur la protection de l'environnement.,1995.0,Romania,"Cette loi porte réglementation de la protection de l'environnement, basée sur les principes conduisant au développement durable de la société. Elle comprend 89 articles répartis en 6 chapitres, à savoir: Principes et dispositions générales (I); Réglementation des activités économiques et sociales ayant impact sur l'environnement (II); Protection des ressources naturelles et conservation de la biodiversité (III); Attributions et responsabilités (IV); Sanctions (V); Dispositions transitoires et finales (VI). Deux annexes complètent cette loi et en forment partie intégrante: la première précise le sens des principaux termes utilisés dans la loi et la deuxième fixe la liste des activités soumises à la procédure d'évaluation de l'impact sur l'environnement en vue de la délivrance de l'accord et/ou l'autorisation d'environnement. Afin d'assurer un développement durable, la loi fixe les principes de base suivants: précaution à la prise de la décision; prévention des risques écologiques; conservation de la biodiversité et des écosystèmes; le principe pollueur=payeur; l'élimination des polluants plus nocifs; l'utilisation durable; le maintien et l'amélioration de la qualité de l'environnement; la participation de la population et des organisations non gouvernementales; la collaboration internationale. La mise en oeuvre de ces principes s'effectuera au moyen de l'adoption de politiques d'environnement appropriées; de l'obligation de l'étude d'impact environnemental; de la corrélation de la planification environnementale avec celle d'aménagement du territoire et d'urbanisme; de l'harmonisation avec la réglementation internationale et l'élaboration de normes et de standards. Cette loi fixe un principe fondamental: l'Etat reconnaît à toutes les personnes le droit à un environnement sain. Conséquemment il garantit à tous en matière d'environnement l'accès à l'information, le droit de s'associer, le droit de consultation et le droit de s'adresser directement aux autorités administratives ou judiciaires aux fins de la prévention ou en cas de préjudice. D'autre part, la protection de l'environnement constitue une obligation, non seulement des autorités de l'administration publique, mais de toutes les personnes physiques et morales. L'autorité centrale chargée de la protection de l'environnement est le Ministère des eaux, des forêts et de la protection de l'environnement. Les activités économiques et sociales ayant impact sur l'environnement nécessitent d'une autorisation et /ou d'un accord d'environnement, qui sera délivré aux conditions prévues par les dispositions du chapitre II de cette loi. Un bilan d'environnement est obligatoire au moment du changement de destination ou du propriétaire d'un investissement ou à la cessation des activités, afin d'établir les obligations qui incombent sur les propriétaires pour refaire la qualité de l'environnement. Certaines activités sont sujettes à un régime spécial de gestion et d'administration. Il s'agit, notamment, des activités liées aux substances et aux déchets dangereux, ainsi qu'aux autres déchets; aux engrais chimiques et aux pesticides; à la protection contre les radiations ionisantes et la sécurité des sources de radiations. Les réglementations techniques portant sur les mesures de protection des écosystèmes, celles de conservation de la biodiversité et d'administration durable des ressources naturelles sont élaborées par l'autorité centrale responsable de la protection de l'environnement. Cette autorité établit les critères pour l'institution des espaces protégés et pour la conservation de la biodiversité, auxquels devront se tenir les détenteurs légaux des surfaces terrestres et aquatiques soumises à un régime de conservation. La loi fixe les principes et les mesures de base concernant la protection des eaux et des écosystèmes aquatiques, de l'atmosphère, du sol, du sous-sol et des écosystèmes terrestres, ainsi que celles relatives aux espaces protégés, aux monuments à caractère naturel et aux habitats humains.
