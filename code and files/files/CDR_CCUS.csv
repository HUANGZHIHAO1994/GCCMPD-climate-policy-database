Instruction Memorandum on the use of pore space on U.S. public lands, 2022,"Pore Space Ownership,United States","This Instruction Memorandum (IM) conveys policy and direction for authorizing rights-of-way (ROWs) to use public lands for site characterization, transportation, injection, capture, and geologic sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2)at appropriately classified injection well locations in connection with CO2 sequestration projects.  This includes authorizing the use of pore space managed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) when surface facilities, including injection wells, are on private or state-owned lands or lands managed by another Federal agency. When authorizing any carbon sequestration projects on public lands, the BLM should issue ROWs under Title V of the Federal Land Policy and Management Act of 1976 (FLPMA), as amended, 43 USC 1761 et seq.  These ROWs should appropriately address construction, operation, maintenance, and termination of surface facilities required to inject CO2 for permanent geologic sequestration.  The BLM should similarly issue Title V ROWs when authorizing the occupation of federal pore space during and after injection operations. This IM is part of a comprehensive strategy to combat climate change and reduce CO2 levels in the atmosphere and applies only to BLM-administered lands.",https://cdrlaw.org/resources/instruction-memorandum-on-the-use-of-pore-space-on-u-s-public-lands/,Policy Proposal,CDR_CCUS

S. 6599 – Climate Leadership and Community Protect Act, 2019,United States,"This bill enacts the New York State Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA) that sets a statewide target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Specifically, the bill requires an 85% emissions reduction by 2050, with any remaining emissions to be either directly reduced or offset through projects that remove greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. The bill lists several different projects that could be implemented to accomplish this goal, which are natural carbon sinks including but not limited to afforestation, reforestation or wetlands restoration, the restoration and sustainable management of coastal wetlands and sub-tidal habitats, and carbon capture and sequestration.The offsets must be verifiable and permanent and represent new, additional reductions in emissions that would not otherwise have occurred. The only emissions that are eligible to be offset are those where it is technologically infeasible to reduce the emissions by other means. Electric generators are not eligible for offsets. The offset program must be designed in a manner that does not disproportionately harm disadvantaged communities. Moreover, to the greatest extent practicable, offset projects must be located within 25 miles of the source they’re offsetting, ensuring that the benefits of offsetting emissions will be locally realized.",https://cdrlaw.org/resources/s-6599-climate-leadership-and-community-protect-act/,Enacted Legislation,CDR_CCUS
H.R.1892 – Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, 2018,"Enhanced Oil Recovery,United States",The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 adopted provisions from the FUTURE Act (introduced in 2017) that increase and extend the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture projects that store or use carbon dioxide. The credit increases the value of geologically stored carbon dioxide to $35 per metric ton when stored through enhanced oil recovery and $50 per metric ton for saline and other forms of geologic storage. The credit also provides a $35 per ton credit for carbon dioxide that is captured and beneficially used in an application beyond enhanced oil recovery. The 45Q tax credit applies to direct air capture and carbon monoxide capture projects as well.,https://cdrlaw.org/resources/%c2%a745q-credit-for-carbon-oxide-sequestration/,Enacted Legislation,CDR_CCUS

26 U.S. Code § 45Q, 2008,"Enhanced Oil Recovery,United States","26 USC §45Q creates a tax credit for the sequestration of carbon dioxide captured from an industrial source. In 2018, through the Bipartisan Budget Act, Congress eliminated the volume cap and raised the value of the tax credits so that they will reach $50 and $35, respectively, for sequestered carbon and carbon used in enhanced oil recovery, and thereafter be adjusted for inflation. The law allows certain new industrial or direct air capture facilities to qualify for the credit if construction begins before January 1, 2024;*See also the following resources (1) H.R.1892 – Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 and (2) S.1535- FUTURE Act",https://cdrlaw.org/resources/26-u-s-code-%c2%a7%e2%80%af45q/,Enacted Legislation,CDR_CCUS

The report also identifies that forests and “blue carbon systems”—including ocean, wetland, and riverine ecosystems—are critical carbon sinks and provide important resilience services. Congress should protect mature and old growth forests; invest in forest restoration, reforestation, and afforestation on public and private lands, including urban areas to improve urban tree canopy; manage wildfire for community safety and ecological health; ensure forest management activities focus on climate and biodiversity benefits; and protect and restore native grasslands. In addition, Congress should increase funding for NOAA to expand research on the ocean carbon cycle, including the effects of declining marine mammal and fish populations on blue carbon sequestration.See the following sections in the report for more detail:",https://cdrlaw.org/resources/solving-the-climate-crisis-the-congressional-action-plan-for-a-clean-energy-economy-and-a-healthy-resilient-and-just-america/,Policy Proposal,CDR_CCUS
