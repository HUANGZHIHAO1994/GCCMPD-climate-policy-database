Department of Energy Proposes Reversal of Heating Efficiency Rollback,2021,USA,"<p>The Department of Energy proposed to reinstate a previous interpretation of energy efficiency rules pertaining to residential furnaces and commercial water heaters.</p>
On August 17, 2021, The Department of Energy (DOE) proposed to reinstate a previous interpretation of energy efficiency rules pertaining to residential furnaces and commercial water heaters.

On January 14, 2021, the DOE issued a final rule that could block future administrations from making gas-fired water heaters, furnaces, and boilers more efficient. Many gas-fired water heaters, furnaces, and boilers currently allow a significant amount of heat to be wasted through venting, but some models use condensing technology to capture heat and prevent waste. In 2018 a number of industry groups petitioned DOE to define condensing and non-condensing equipment as separate categories with separate efficiency standards. The final rule defines non-condensing technology, which requires venting, as a performance-related ""feature"" under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act that cannot be eliminated through adoption of an energy conservation standard. By creating two separate classes -- one for models with condensing capabilities and one for models without such capabilities -- DOE limits future administrations' authority to require condensing equipment for all gas-fired water heaters, furnaces and boilers. The August 2021 proposal, if finalized, would reinstate the previous interpretation and therefore allow DOE to require condensing equipment for all such appliances.",https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/department-energy-proposes-reversal-heating-efficiency-rollback,National,Notification of proposed interpretive rule,DOE,Climate-Reregulation-Tracker

NHTSA Proposes More Stringent Fuel Economy Standards,2021,USA,"<p>The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration proposed more stringent corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for passenger cars and light trucks for model years 2024–2026.</p>
On September 3, 2021, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, on behalf of the Department of Transportation, proposed revised corporate average fuel economy (CAFE) standards for passenger cars and light trucks for model years 2024–2026. This proposal continues NHTSA’s implementation of President Biden’s January 20, 2021 Executive order, “Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science To Tackle the Climate Crisis.’’ In that order, President Biden directed that the 2020 “Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule for Model Years 2021–2026 Passenger Cars and Light Trucks’’ be immediately reviewed for consistency with public health, environmental, and other policy goals, and that the Secretary of Transportation consider suspending, revising, or rescinding the 2020 rule by July 2021. Following President Biden’s directive, NHTSA reviewed the 2020 rule under its authority to set CAFE standards and concluded that, consistent with NHTSA’s statutory mandate to improve energy conservation, the 2020 standards should be revised so that they increase at a rate of 8 percent year over year for each model year from 2024 through 2026, for both passenger cars and light trucks. This proposed rule would revise the CAFE standards accordingly and would also make minor changes to fuel economy reporting requirements.

NHTSA’s proposal follows EPA’s August 5, 2021 proposal of strengthened greenhouse gas standards for light-duty motor vehicles for model years 2023–26, which likewise implemented President Biden’s January 2021 order.

EPA Proposes Rule Requiring Companies to Capture and Destroy Byproduct Greenhouse Gas,2021,USA,"<p>The Environmental Protection Agency proposed a rule that would require companies to control, capture, and/or destroy HFC-23, which is generated as a byproduct during the manufacture of HCFCs.</p>
On September 29, 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed a rule that would require manufacturing plants to control, capture, and/or destroy HFC-23. HFC-23 is a powerful greenhouse gas that is generated during the manufacture of certain class II ozone-depleting substances, including HCFC-22. According to EPA, HFC-23 has a substantially longer atmospheric lifetime and higher global warming potential than all other HFCs. This proposal follows a September 23, 2021 rule that established an allowance trading program for the phase out of all HFCs.

Under the proposed rule, HFC-23 must be captured and employed for a commercial use or destroyed using a technology approved by the Environmental Protection Agency, thereby ensuring it is not directly emitted. The rule would be narrow in scope, only affecting plants that continue to manufacture HCFCs under an exception to the HCFC phaseout under the Clean Air Act and its implementing regulations.

On October 1, 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency released its FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan Draft. EPA’s strategic plans are meant to communicate the agency’s priorities and provide a roadmap for achieving its them. The first-listed goal in the Draft Plan is to “[t]ackle the climate crisis,” which the Draft Plan breaks down into three separate objectives:

Objective 1.1: Reduce Emissions that Cause Climate Change
	Objective 1.2: Accelerate Resilience and Adaptation to Climate Change Impacts
	Objective 1.3: Advance International and Subnational Climate Efforts
The Draft Plan includes information on strategies and long-term performance goals pertinent to each objective. It also emphasizes that “[p]olicies to tackle climate change must address the disproportionate vulnerability of low-income communities and communities of color while also dealing with the legacy pollution those communities continue to endure.” This Draft Plan contrasts with EPA’s Strategic Plan for Fiscal Years 2018-2022, which made no mention of climate change.

CEQ Begins Process of Restoring NEPA Review of Cumulative Impacts,2021,USA,"<p>The Council on Environmental Quality issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to restore NEPA requirements relevant to the review of climate impacts.</p>
On October 7, 2021, the Council on Environmental Quality published a notice of proposed rulemaking to restore regulations under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) that the Trump administration had removed in a 2020 rule. The proposed rule—which is “Phase 1” of the agency’s plan to restore NEPA to its pre-2020 rigor—would make three major changes to current NEPA regulations. First, the proposed rule would require agencies to consider the “direct,” “indirect,” and “cumulative” impacts of proposed agency decisions. Review of cumulative impacts, which the Trump administration’s 2020 rule removed from the NEPA process, is frequently necessary to understand a project’s contribution to climate change. Cumulative impacts are also relevant to environmental justice analyses. In addition to restoring review of cumulative impacts, the proposed rule would also restore Federal agencies’ authority to develop and analyze project alternatives to minimize the environmental and public health costs of a proposed project. Finally, the proposed rule would allow Federal agencies to go beyond NEPA’s minimum requirements in their environmental review.

DOL Proposes Removing Trump-Era Barriers to Consideration of Climate Change When Managing Pensions and Retirement Savings,2021,USA,"<p>The Department of Labor published a proposed rule under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act that would allow fiduciaries to consider climate change, along with other environmental, social, and governance factors, when they select investments and exercise shareholder rights.</p>
On October 14, 2021, the Department of Labor’s Employee Benefits Security Administration published a proposed amendment to the Investment Duties regulation that would allow fiduciaries to consider climate risks, along with other environmental, social, and governance factors, when they select investments and exercise shareholder rights. The rule, proposed under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), would apply to the selection of investments and investment courses of action, including selecting qualified default investment alternatives, exercising shareholder rights, such as proxy voting, and the use of written proxy voting policies and guidelines. This proposed rule would remove regulatory barriers established in 2020 that prevent fiduciaries to consider the above-listed factors when acting under ERISA. Prior to the 2020 rule, the Department of Labor had relied on non-regulatory guidance to permit ERISA fiduciaries to conduct investment and shareholder rights activities in a manner that reflected climate change and other considerations.

EPA Proposes Methane Emissions Controls for Oil and Gas Sources,2021,USA,"<p>The Environmental Protection Agency proposed a suite of regulations to control methane emissions from the oil and gas sector under the Clean Air Act.</p>
On November 15, 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency published a proposed rule to limit methane emissions from U.S. oil and gas infrastructure under the Clean Air Act. EPA’s proposed rule includes three distinct groups of actions. First, EPA is proposing to revise the new source performance standards for methane and volatile organic compound emissions for the Crude Oil and Natural Gas source category. Second, EPA is proposing nationwide emissions guidelines for states to follow in developing, submitting, and implementing state plans to establish performance standards for limiting methane emissions from existing sources in the Crude Oil and Natural Gas source category. Finally, EPA is proposing to reverse a rule governing methane emissions that was finalized during the Trump administration, titled “Oil and Natural Gas Sector: Emission Standards for New, Reconstructed, and Modified Sources Review,” which had substantially weakened the regulation of methane emissions in the oil and gas industry. Congress had formally disapproved of the Trump administration rule under the Congressional Review Act, and President Biden had directed EPA to consider suspending, revising, or rescinding the rule in his Executive Order on Protecting Public Health and the Environment and Restoring Science to Tackle the Climate Crisis.

Among other actions, EPA’s proposed rule would establish a monitoring program to require companies to address fugitive emissions at new and existing well sites and compressor stations; would require all new and existing pneumatic controllers at production, processing, and transmission and storage facilities to produce zero methane and volatile organic compound emissions (with limited exceptions for certain Alaska facilities); would eliminate the venting of associated gas from oil wells; would add storage tank batteries to the definition of facilities that must reduce methane and volatile organic compound emissions; and would broaden the types of pneumatic pumps covered by the rule.

PHMSA Considers Suspending Trump-Era Authorization of LNG Transport by Rail,2021,USA,"<p>The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration proposed to amend the Hazardous Materials Regulations to suspend authorization of liquefied natural gas transportation in rail tank cars.</p>
On November 8, 2021, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) proposed to amend the Hazardous Materials Regulations to suspend authorization of liquefied natural gas (LNG) transportation in rail tank cars. LNG transport by rail was authorized in a June 2020 rule that was meant to facilitate the transportation of natural gas to markets where pipeline transportation is limited or unavailable. The proposed rule discusses potential public safety and environmental impacts from transporting LNG by rail, including indirect GHG emission contributions to climate change. Suspension of LNG transport by rail under the proposed rule would last until the earlier of either the completion of a separate rulemaking evaluating potential modifications to requirements governing rail tank car transportation of LNG, or June 30, 2024.

EPA and ACOE Propose a Definition of “Waters of the United States” That Is Adaptive to Climate Change,2021,USA,"<p>The Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers proposed a revised definition of ""waters of the United States” that allows for consideration of the effects of climate change on water resources when determining federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act.</p>
On December 7, 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Army Corps of Engineers (ACOE) proposed a revised definition of ""waters of the United States” that allows for consideration of the effects of climate change on water resources when determining federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. As explained in the proposed rule, “[t]his term establishes the extent of most federal programs to protect water quality under the [Clean Water] Act—including, for example, water quality standards, impaired waters and total maximum daily loads, oil spill prevention, preparedness and response programs, state and tribal water quality certification programs, and dredged and fill programs—because such programs apply only to ‘waters of the United States.’”

In the proposed rule, EPA and ACOE interpret the term ‘‘waters of the United States’’ to include: “Traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, and the territorial seas, and their adjacent wetlands; most impoundments of ‘waters of the United States’; tributaries to traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, the territorial seas, and impoundments that meet either the relatively permanent standard or the significant nexus standard; wetlands adjacent to impoundments and tributaries, that meet either the relatively permanent standard or the significant nexus standard; and ‘other waters’ that meet either the relatively permanent standard or the significant nexus standard.” The agencies specify that “the ‘significant nexus standard’ means waters that either alone or in combination with similarly situated waters in the region, significantly affect the chemical, physical, or biological integrity of traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, or the territorial seas.” The agencies further specify that the significant nexus standard allows them to consider climate change when evaluating if upstream waters significantly affect foundational waters.

Department of Energy Finalizes Reversal of Heating Efficiency Rollback,2021,USA,"<p>The Department of Energy&nbsp;reinstated a previous interpretation of energy efficiency rules pertaining to residential furnaces and commercial water heaters.</p>
On December 29, 2021, the Department of Energy finalized a rule that reinstates a previous interpretation of energy efficiency rules pertaining to residential furnaces and commercial water heaters.

The December 2021 rule reverses a January 2021 rule that risked blocking future administrations from making gas-fired water heaters, furnaces, and boilers more efficient. Many gas-fired water heaters, furnaces, and boilers currently allow a significant amount of heat to be wasted through venting, but some models use condensing technology to capture heat and prevent waste. In 2018 a number of industry groups petitioned DOE to define condensing and non-condensing equipment as separate categories with separate efficiency standards. The January 2021 rule defined non-condensing technology, which requires venting, as a performance-related ""feature"" under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act that cannot be eliminated through adoption of an energy conservation standard. By creating two separate classes -- one for models with condensing capabilities and one for models without such capabilities -- DOE's January rule had limited future administrations' authority to require condensing equipment for all gas-fired water heaters, furnaces and boilers. The December 2021 proposal reinstates the previous interpretation and therefore allows DOE to require condensing equipment for all such appliances.",https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/department-energy-finalizes-reversal-heating-efficiency-rollback,National,Final rule,DOE,Climate-Reregulation-Tracker
DOE Finalizes Reversal of Energy Efficiency Rollbacks,2022,USA,"<p>The Department of Energy finalized a rule reversing energy efficiency rollbacks issued by the prior administration for dishwashers, washing machines, and dryers.&nbsp;</p>
On January 19, 2022, the Department of Energy finalized a rule revoking two energy efficiency rules issued by the prior administration.

On October 30, 2020, DOE established a new product class for standard residential dishwashers with a cycle time for the normal cycle of one hour or less from washing through drying under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. On December 16, 2020, DOE similarly established separate product classes for certain washing machines and dryers under the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. Energy efficiency advocates expressed concern that the new classifications would allow appliances fitting into new product classes to avoid more stringent standards. The January 2022 final rule revokes both rules and reinstates the prior product classes and applicable standards for dishwashers, washing machines, and dryers.",https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/doe-finalizes-reversal-energy-efficiency-rollbacks,National,Final rule,DOE,Climate-Reregulation-Tracker
EPA Proposes Reinstating Finding Underpinning Mercury and Air Toxics Regulations for Power Plants,2022,USA,"<p>The Environmental Protection Agency proposed revoking a 2020 rule that stated it was not appropriate and necessary to regulate mercury and air toxics from coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units under Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112.</p>
On January 31, 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed revoking a 2020 rule that stated it was not appropriate and necessary to regulate mercury and air toxics (MATS) from coal- and oil-fired electric utility steam generating units (EGUs) under Clean Air Act (CAA) Section 112. The 2020 rule relied on EPA's rejection of the value of co-benefits — reductions in other pollutants not directly covered by MATS. While the 2020 rule did not rescind a 2012 rule requiring facilities to achieve an emissions rate for MATS consistent with the implementation of the maximum available control technology (MACT), advocates had worried that EPA’s refusal to consider co-benefits would make it more difficult to justify future rulemakings that are protective of public health. EPA’s January 2021 proposed rule would also reaffirm the pre-2020 finding that it is appropriate and necessary to regulate hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions from EGUs after considering cost.

EPA is accepting comments until April 11, 2022. EPA is also soliciting information on the performance and cost of new or improved technologies that control HAP emissions, improved methods of operation, and relevant risk-related information.",https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/epa-proposes-reinstating-finding-underpinning-mercury-and-air-toxics-regulations-power,National,Proposed Rule,EPA,Climate-Reregulation-Tracker

EPA Restores California’s Authority to Set Climate-Protective Vehicle Emissions Standards,2022,USA,"<p>The Environmental Protection Agency rescinded its 2019 withdrawal of a waiver that allows California to set vehicle emissions standards that are more climate-protective than federal requirements.&nbsp;</p>
On March 9, 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) took final action to restore California’s authority to set its own vehicle emissions standards that are more climate-protective than federal requirements. EPA’s mandate to set emission standards for new motor vehicles under the Clean Air Act generally preempts states’ ability to establish such standards. However, California can seek a waiver to set its own regulations that are at least as protective as applicable federal rules, which other states may follow.

In 2013 EPA granted California a preemption waiver for its Advanced Clean Car (ACC) regulations.  The ACC program is comprised of California’s low emission vehicle program, greenhouse gas standards, and zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) program.  The ZEV program requires a certain percentage of vehicles in the state to produce no carbon dioxide tailpipe emissions. In 2019, EPA partially withdrew the waiver as part of “The Safer Affordable Fuel-Efficient (SAFE) Vehicles Rule Part One: One National Program” (SAFE 1).” EPA also announced an interpretation of the Clean Air Act that prevented other states from adopting California’s greenhouse gas standards.

The March 9 Notice of Decision rescinds the 2019 waiver withdraw, bringing the 2013 ACC program waiver back into force, and additionally rescinds the 2019 interpretation that prevented other states from adopting California’s greenhouse gas standards.",https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/epa-restores-californias-authority-set-climate-protective-vehicle-emissions-standards,National,Notice of Determination,EPA,Climate-Reregulation-Tracker

GSA Releases Concrete and Asphalt Standards for Federal Contractors to Reduce Climate Impacts,2022,USA,"<p>The General Service Administration released standards to limit the global warming potential of concrete and asphalt used by federal contractors.</p>
On March 30, 2022, the General Service Administration (GSA) released its “Low Embodied Carbon Concrete Standards for all GSA Projects.” The standards contain Global Warming Potential (GWP) limits for various classes of concrete. Federal contractors must use concrete that meets these standards for all GSA projects that use at least ten cubic yards of concrete, though the GSA allows a waiver from these requirements in certain circumstances.  

On March 29, 2022, the General Service Administration (GSA) released its revised “Environmentally Preferable Asphalt Standards for all GSA Projects.” Under these standards, contractors must provide “environmentally preferable asphalt,” which is defined as material manufactured or installed using at least two of the following techniques:

“a. Greater than 20% recycled asphalt pavement (RAP) content (specify percentage, and whether in-place or central plant recycling is used);

 b. Warm mix technology (reduced onsite mix temperature);

c. Non-pavement recycled content (e.g. roof shingles, rubber, or plastic);

d. Bio-based or other alternative binders;

e. Improved energy/ carbon efficiency of manufacturing plants or equipment (e.g. using natural gas or electric for heating materials);

or f. Other environmentally preferable features or techniques (please specify).”

CEQ Finalizes the First Phase of its Revisions to NEPA Regulations,2022,USA,"<p>The Council on Environmental Quality finalized “Phase 1” of its efforts to restore NEPA regulations to their pre-2020 rigor.</p>
On April 20, 2022, the Council on Environmental Quality restored regulations under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) that the Trump administration had removed in a 2020 rule. The April 2022 rule—which is “Phase 1” of the agency’s plan to restore NEPA to its pre-2020 rigor—makes several major changes to NEPA regulations. First, the rule requires agencies to consider the “direct,” “indirect,” and “cumulative” impacts of proposed agency decisions. Review of cumulative impacts, which the Trump administration’s 2020 rule removed from the NEPA process, is frequently necessary to understand a project’s contribution to climate change. Cumulative impacts are also relevant to environmental justice analyses. In addition to restoring review of cumulative impacts, the rule also restores federal agencies’ authority to develop and analyze project alternatives to minimize the environmental and public health costs of a proposed project. Relatedly, the rule clarifies that agencies have discretion to assess a variety of factors related to a project’s “purpose and need,” removing a requirement that limited an agency to considering the applicant’s stated goals and the agency’s statutory authority. Finally, the rule allows federal agencies to go beyond NEPA’s minimum requirements in their environmental review.",https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/ceq-finalizes-first-phase-its-revisions-nepa-regulations,National,Final rule,CEQ,Climate-Reregulation-Tracker

DOE Adopts Two Final Rules Setting Stricter Energy Efficiency Standards for Light Bulbs,2022,USA,"<p>The Department of Energy finalized two rules reversing the previous administration’s rollback of energy efficiency standards for light bulbs.</p>
On April 26, 2022, the Department of Energy (DOE) finalized two rules reversing the previous administration’s rollback of energy efficiency standards for light bulbs. In the first rule, DOE has codified a 45 lumens per watt (“lm/W”) backstop energy efficiency requirement for general service lamps (“GSLs”) that Congress prescribed in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act. In the second rule, DOE has reinstated rescinded definitional rules pertaining to “general service lamps” and “general service incandescent lamps” to expand the types of light bulbs that will be covered by the more stringent standards.

Both of these rules reverse rollbacks put in place under the previous administration In January 2017 DOE had finalized regulations expanding the types of light bulbs subject to energy efficiency standards under the Environmental Policy and Conservation Act by redefining ""general service lamp"" and strengthened standards to phase out less-efficient incandescent light bulbs. These regulations were scheduled to come into effect in January 2020. In late 2019, DOE repealed those rules and blocked the phaseout of incandescent light bulbs.",https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/doe-adopts-two-final-rules-setting-stricter-energy-efficiency-standards-light-bulbs,National,Final rule,DOE,Climate-Reregulation-Tracker

The White House Releases Action Plan for Federal Permitting and Environmental Reviews,2022,USA,"<p>The White House published a “Permitting Action Plan to Rebuild America’s Infrastructure, Accelerate the Clean Energy Transition, Revitalize Communities, and Create Jobs.”</p>
On May 11, 2022, the White House published a “Permitting Action Plan to Rebuild America’s Infrastructure, Accelerate the Clean Energy Transition, Revitalize Communities, and Create Jobs.” The plan centers on five key elements to strengthen federal environmental review and permitting:

(1) accelerating permitting through early cross-agency coordination to appropriately scope reviews, reduce bottlenecks, and use the expertise of sector-specific teams;

(2) establishing clear timeline goals and tracking key project information to improve transparency and accountability, providing increased certainty for project sponsors and the public;

(3) engaging in early and meaningful outreach and communication with Tribal Nations, States, territories, and local communities;

(4) improving agency responsiveness, technical assistance, and support to navigate the environmental review and permitting process effectively and efficiently; and

(5) adequately resourcing agencies and using the environmental review process to improve environmental and community outcomes.

EPA Proposed Reversing 2020 Changes to Water Quality Certification Rules,2022,USA,"<p>The Environmental Protection Agency proposed&nbsp;revising and replacing its 2020 regulatory requirements for water quality certification under Clean Water Act (CWA) section 401.</p>
On June 3, 2022, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed revising and replacing its 2020 regulatory requirements for water quality certification under Clean Water Act (CWA) section 401. Section 401 provides states and authorized tribes the power to grant, condition, or deny certification for federally licensed or permitted projects, including natural gas pipelines, that may result in a discharge into waters of the United States. In a 2020 rule revising the prior 1971 rule, EPA had limited the power of states and tribes to review the impacts of such projects and to deny such certifications. The 2022 proposal would return reverse those 2020 changes.

FWS Proposes Accounting for Climate Change-Driven Habitat Changes When Reintroducing Species,2022,USA,"<p>The Fish and Wildlife Service proposed a rule that would allow the introduction of endangered or threatened species outside of their historic range to account for climate impacts.</p>
On June 6, 2022, the Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) proposed a rule that would allow the reintroduction of endangered or threatened species outside of their historic range to account for climate impacts. Section 10(j) of the Endangered Species Act allows FWS to designate “experimental populations” of such species that may be released outside of their current range for the purpose of species conservation. Current FWS regulations only allow for the introduction of endangered species within their “historical range.” The proposed rule would remove that limitation. As explained in the proposed rule, FWS has “concluded that it may be increasingly necessary and appropriate to establish experimental populations outside of their historical range if the ability of the habitat to support one or more life history stages has been reduced due to threats, such as climate change or invasive species.”

Proposed Reconsideration of Fugitive Emissions Rule,2022,USA,"<p>The EPA has proposed revisions to the Clean Air Act’s New Source Review (NSR) permitting regulations, which would require the owners/operators of all existing industrial facilities considered “major sources” to include “fugitive” emissions of air pollutants when determining whether a physical or operational change at their facility is a “major modification” which would need a major NSR permit before starting construction.&nbsp;</p>
On October 14, 2022, the EPA proposed revisions to the Clean Air Act’s New Source Review (NSR) permitting regulations.  This action would require facility owners/operators of all existing industrial facilities considered “major sources” to include “fugitive” emissions of air pollutants when determining whether a physical or operational change at their facility is a “major modification” which would need a major NSR permit before starting construction.  The permit would include required emission control measures to ensure that changes at the facility would not degrade air quality. “Fugitive emissions” are emissions that could not reasonably pass through a stack, chimney, vent, or similar opening. 

As part of this action, the EPA has reconsidered a 2008 rule requiring only certain types of industrial source categories to include fugitive emissions when determining whether a change is a major modification.  In response to a 2009 petition for reconsideration of the 2008 Fugitive Emissions rule, EPA stayed the rule’s effectiveness and later amended portions of the agency’s NSR regulations to reflect earlier requirements. To bring closure to the reconsideration proceeding, the EPA is proposing to fully repeal the 2008 rule by removing certain remaining stayed provisions of the regulations adopted in 2008. EPA also is proposing to remove a related exemption for modifications that would be considered major solely due to the inclusion of fugitive emissions. As a result of the proposed changes, all existing major stationary sources would be required to include fugitive emissions in determining whether a project is a major modification. These changes would more effectively carry out the purposes of the NSR program to preserve and/or improve air quality and will provide greater clarity to all stakeholders.

On November 14, 2022, EPA extended the comment period for this rule. EPA is accepting comments until February 14, 2023.",https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/proposed-reconsideration-fugitive-emissions-rule,National,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,EPA,Climate-Reregulation-Tracker

"DOD, GSA, and NASA Propose Climate Disclosures for Large Federal Contractors",2022,USA,"<p>DoD, GSA, and NASA are proposing amendments to the Federal Acquisition Regulation to require certain Federal contractors to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risks, and require those contractors to set science-based targets to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.</p>
On November 14, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD), General Services Administration (GSA), and National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) issued a proposed rule amending the Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) to implement a requirement to ensure that certain Federal contractors disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and climate-related financial risk and set science-based targets to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

This rule proposes to separate “major Federal suppliers” into two categories:

""Significant contractors,"" who received between $7.5 and $50 million in Federal contract obligations in the previous year, and
	""Major contractors,"" who received more than $50 million in Federal contract obligations in the previous year.
Per this proposed rule, both significant contractors and major contractors would be subject to annual Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions disclosure requirements. Major contractors would also be subject to the annual climate disclosure, which includes disclosure of Scope 3 GHG emissions, and science-based target requirements.

On December 23, 2022, DoD, GAS, and NASA extended the comment period for the proposed rule until February 13, 2023.",https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/dod-gsa-and-nasa-propose-climate-disclosures-large-federal-contractors,National,Proposed Rule,"DOD,GSA,NASA",Climate-Reregulation-Tracker
BLM Proposes New Regulations to Reduce Natural Gas Flaring and Leakage,2022,USA,"<p>The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) is proposing new regulations to reduce the waste of natural gas from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas production activities on Federal and Indian leases. The proposed regulations would be codified in the Code of Federal Regulations and would replace the BLM's current requirements governing venting and flaring, which are more than four decades old.</p>
On November 30, 2022, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) proposed new regulations to reduce the waste of natural gas from venting, flaring, and leaks during oil and gas production activities on Federal and Indian leases. The proposed regulations would replace the BLM's current requirements governing venting and flaring, which are more than four decades old.

Vented or leaked gas contributes significantly to climate change, because the primary constituent of natural gas is methane, an especially powerful greenhouse gas, with climate impacts roughly 28-36 times those of carbon dioxide (CO2), if measured over a 100-year period, or 84 times those of CO2 if measured over a 20-year period.

The BLM anticipates the regulation will have the following economic impact:

Costs to industry of around $122 million per year (annualized at 7 percent);
	Benefits to industry in recovered gas of $55 million per year (annualized at 7 percent);
	Increases in royalty revenues from recovered and flared gas of $39 million per year; and
	Benefits to society of $427 million per year from reduced greenhouse gas emissions.
However, an earlier BLM regulation, the ""Waste Prevention Rule,"" was struck down in Wyoming v. DOI, 493 F. Supp. 3d 1046 (D. Wyo. 2020) after a finding that the rule was inappropriately supported by “climate change benefits"" and exceeded BLM's statutory authority. These new regulations take a different approach. While BLM has published a separate Regulatory Impact Analysis discussing the benefits derived from GHG reductions, BLM argues that requirements of this proposed rule reflect reasonable measures to avoid waste that could be expected of a prudent operator, irrespective of any impacts with respect to climate change.

The BLM will accept comments to this proposed rule until January 30, 2022.",https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/blm-proposes-new-regulations-reduce-natural-gas-flaring-and-leakage,National,Proposed Rule,"BLM,DOI",Climate-Reregulation-Tracker

Council on Environmental Quality Issues Interim Guidance on Agency Consideration of GHG Emissions and Climate Change,2023,USA,"<p>The Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) has issued interim guidance to assist agencies in analyzing greenhouse gas and climate change effects of their proposed actions under the National Environmental Policy Act. CEQ is issuing this guidance as interim guidance so that agencies may make use of it immediately while CEQ seeks public comment on the guidance. CEQ intends to either revise the guidance in response to public comments or finalize the interim guidance.</p>
On January 9, 2023, the Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) issued interim guidance to assist agencies in analyzing greenhouse gas (GHG) and climate change effects of their proposed actions under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). CEQ is issuing this guidance as interim guidance so that agencies may make use of it immediately while CEQ seeks public comment on the guidance. CEQ intends to either revise the guidance in response to public comments or finalize the interim guidance.

This guidance explains how agencies should apply NEPA principles and existing best practices to their climate change analyses by:

Recommending that agencies leverage early planning processes to integrate GHG emissions and climate change considerations into the identification of proposed actions, reasonable alternatives (as well as the no-action alternative), and potential mitigation and resilience measures;
	Recommending that agencies quantify a proposed action's projected GHG emissions or reductions for the expected lifetime of the action, considering available data and GHG quantification tools that are suitable for the proposed action;
	Recommending that agencies use projected GHG emissions associated with proposed actions and their reasonable alternatives to help assess potential climate change effects;
	Recommending that agencies provide additional context for GHG emissions, including through the use of the best available social cost of GHG (SC-GHG) estimates, to translate climate impacts into the more accessible metric of dollars, allow decision makers and the public to make comparisons, help evaluate the significance of an action's climate change effects, and better understand the tradeoffs associated with an action and its alternatives;
	Discussing methods to appropriately analyze reasonably foreseeable direct, indirect, and cumulative GHG emissions;
	Guiding agencies in considering reasonable alternatives and mitigation measures, as well as addressing short- and long-term climate change effects;
	Advising agencies to use the best available information and science when assessing the potential future state of the affected environment in NEPA analyses and providing up to date examples of existing sources of scientific information;
	Recommending agencies use the information developed during the NEPA review to consider reasonable alternatives that would make the actions and affected communities more resilient to the effects of a changing climate.
On February 16, 2023, CEQ extended the period for comment in response to public requests for an extension of the response period.

EPA Publishes Revised Proposed Standards for GHG Emissions from Crude Oil and Natural Gas Sources,2023,USA,"<p>EPA has issued a supplemental notice of proposed rulemaking that revises and strengthens a proposed rule issued in November 2021. The rule is intended to&nbsp;mitigate climate-destabilizing pollution and protect human health by reducing GHG and VOC emissions from the Oil and Natural Gas industry. The supplemental notice strengthens the standards proposed in the November 2021 rule, as well as making a number of technical changes.</p>
On December 6, 2022, EPA issued a supplemental proposal to update, strengthen, and expand the standards proposed on November 15, 2021 (November 2021 proposal), which are intended to significantly reduce emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and other harmful air pollutants from the Crude Oil and Natural Gas source category.

The supplemental proposal contains four major revisions to the November 2021 proposal. First, EPA proposes standards for certain sources that were not addressed in the November 2021 proposal. Second, EPA proposes revisions that strengthen standards for sources of leaks, provide greater flexibility to use innovative advanced detection methods, and establish a ""super emitter response program."" Third, EPA proposes to modify and refine certain elements of the proposed standards in response to information submitted in public comments on the November 2021 proposal. Fourth, EPA proposes details of the timelines and other implementation requirements that apply to states to limit methane pollution from existing designated facilities in the source category under the Clean Air Act (CAA).

EPA is accepting comments on this supplemental proposal until February 13, 2023.",https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/epa-publishes-revised-proposed-standards-ghg-emissions-crude-oil-and-natural-gas-sources,National,"Supplemental Notice of Proposed Rulemaking,Notice of Proposed Rulemaking",EPA,Climate-Reregulation-Tracker
DOE Declines to Strengthen Energy Conservation Standards for Air Conditioners and Heat Pumps,2023,USA,"<p>As part of statutorily mandated update to energy efficiency regulations, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has finalized its review of energy conservation standards for Packaged Terminal Air Conditioners and Packaged Terminal Heat Pumps, and determined that energy conservation standards for these products do not need to be amended.</p>
As part of statutorily mandated update to energy efficiency regulations, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has finalized its review of energy conservation standards for Packaged Terminal Air Conditioners (PTACs) and Packaged Terminal Heat Pumps (PTHPs). In a final determination, DOE has determined that it lacks clear and convincing evidence that more-stringent standards for PTACs and PTHPs would be economically justified. As such, DOE has determined that energy conservation standards for PTACs and PHTPs do not need to be amended.

This rulemaking will be effective on March 15, 2023.",https://climate.law.columbia.edu/content/doe-declines-strengthen-energy-conservation-standards-air-conditioners-and-heat-pumps,National,Final rule,,Climate-Reregulation-Tracker
Department of Energy Proposes No Increases to Energy Efficiency Standards for Single Package Vertical Units,2022,USA,"<p>As part of statutorily mandated update to energy efficiency regulations, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has conducted an evaluation of its energy conservation standards for&nbsp;single package vertical air conditioners (SPVACs) and single package vertical heat pumps (SPVHPs), collectively referred to as single package vertical units (SPVUs). While DOE proposes a new metric to measure cooling efficiency, DOE does not propose increasing the stringency of SPVU energy standards.</p><p>DOE is accepting written comments, data, and information on these proposed standards until February 6, 2023, and will hold a public meeting via webinar on Monday, January 29, 2023.</p>
On December 8, 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) announced that it had conducted an evaluation of its energy conservation standards for single package vertical air conditioners (SPVACs) and single package vertical heat pumps (SPVHPs), collectively referred to as single package vertical units (SPVUs). While DOE proposes a new metric to measure cooling efficiency, DOE does not propose increasing the stringency of SPVU energy standards.

DOE will hold a public meeting via webinar on Monday, January 29, 2023, from 1:00 PM to 4:00 PM.  Webinar registration information, participant instructions, and information about the capabilities available to webinar participants will be published on DOE's website at www.energy.gov/​eere/​buildings/​public-meetings-and-comment-deadlines.

EPA Proposes Restrictions on the Use of Certain Hydrofluorocarbons in Specific Sectors and Subsectors,2022,USA,"<p>As part of implementing the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed regulations to, among other things, restrict the use of hydrofluorocarbons in specific sectors or subsectors in which they are used, establish a process for submitting technology transitions petitions, and establish recordkeeping and reporting requirements.</p><p>&nbsp;</p>
On December 15, 2022, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed regulations to: restrict the use of hydrofluorocarbons in specific sectors or subsectors in which they are used; establish a process for submitting technology transitions petitions; establish recordkeeping and reporting requirements; and address certain other elements related to the effective implementation of the American Innovation and Manufacturing Act of 2020 (AIM Act).

These regulations focus on a core goal of the AIM Act: facilitating the transition to next-generation technologies by restricting use of HFCs in the sectors or subsectors in which they are used.

EPA will hold a virtual public hearing on this proposed rulemaking on December 30, 2022. The date, time, and other relevant information for the virtual public hearing will be available at https://www.epa.gov/​climate-hfcs-reduction.
