Nordic Environmental Protection Convention,1974,"Denmark,Finland,Norway,Sweden","Objective: To safeguard environmental interests in the case of nuisances arising from environmentally harmful activities implemented in other Contracting States. Summary of provisions: Article 1 defines environmentally harmful activities and specifies that the Convention applies only insofar as environmentally harmful activities are not regulated by a special agreement between two or more Contracting Parties. Any person who is affected, or may be affected, by a nuisance caused by environmentally harmful activities in another Contracting State has the right to bring before a Court or Administrative Authority of that State the question of permissibility of such activities including measures to prevent and compensate damages.  He or she also has the right to appeal the decision of that body to the same extent and on the same terms as a legal entity of the State in which the activities are being carried out (art. 3). Moreover, each State undertakes to appoint a supervisory authority to safeguard general environmental interests regarding nuisance arising out of environmentally harmful activities in another Contracting State.  That authority has the right to institute proceedings before the competent court or administrative authority of another Contracting State regarding the permissibility of the environmentally harmful activities under the condition that such an authority in the other State can do the same (art. 4). The supervisory authority may publish communications from the examining authority in the local newspaper or in some other suitable manner and may institute investigations of the effects in its own State (art.7). If necessary in determining the damage caused in another State by environmentally harmful activities, the supervisory authority of the other State undertakes to make arrangements for on-site inspection (art. 10).  Where the permissibility of environmentally harmful activities is examined by the Government or an appropriate Minister, consultations are to take place between the States concerned (art. 11).

Convention for the Protection of Birds Useful to Agriculture,1902,"Austria,Czechoslovakia,France,Germany,Hungary,Liechtenstein,Monaco,Poland,Portugal,Switzerland","Objective: To preserve birds useful to agriculture. Summary of provisions: Article 1 sets out the principle by which birds that are useful to agriculture, especially insectivores, and particularly those mentioned in List N° 1, are to enjoy absolute protection; it is forbidden to kill them at any time and in any manner, or to destroy their nests, eggs or hatching. Until this protection is implemented everywhere and altogether, the Contracting Parties agree to take or propose the necessary dispositions to ensure the implementation of the measures exposed in the following articles. It is forbidden to take away nests, take eggs, capture or destroy hatches at any time and by any means.  Moreover, are to be forbidden, inter alia, the import, transit, transport, sale or purchase of nests, eggs or hatch except when the nests are inside or against houses, buildings or inside courtyards (art. 2) as well as the setting and use of traps, cages, nets, and any other means used to facilitate capture or mass destruction of birds (art. 3). If Parties cannot implement these prohibitions immediately, they may lessen them; however, they undertake to restrain the use of methods, devices and means for capture and destruction to progressively implement the measures of article 3 (art. 4). Aside from the general prohibitions of article 3, it is forbidden to take or kill, release or sell, from March 1st to September 15th of each year, the birds mentioned on List N°1. If their legislation allows it, Contracting Parties undertake to prohibit the entry and transit of the said birds as well as their transport during the period mentioned above (art. 5). The competent authorities may exceptionally grant owners or managers of e.g. vineyards, orchards, or fields, the temporary right to shoot with a firearm birds whose presence would be harmful and would cause real damage. It remains forbidden to release or sell the birds killed in these conditions (art. 6).  Under certain conditions, competent authorities may grant exceptions to the provisions of this Convention for scientific purposes or for re-population.  With the same precaution measures, the capture, sale, and custody of birds intended to be held in a cage may be permitted (art. 7). The provisions of this Convention do not apply to barnyard birds or game birds existing in a hunting preserve. Institutional mechanisms: When it will be deemed necessary, the Contracting Parties will send representatives to an international meeting to examine the questions that are raised by the implementation of the Convention and to propose modifications whose experience will have demonstrated usefulness (art. 12).
