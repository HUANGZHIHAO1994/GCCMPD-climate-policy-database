The three energy strategies selected by the task force are: 1. Designing a demand-side management program focusing on utility, residential, and commercial sectors. 2. Developing an outreach and education plan focused on energy conservation in government agencies and businesses, including workplace rules. 3. Exploring waste-to-energy options. The task force also discussed several other medium- and long-term energy strategies that could be explored at a future date. Those strategies are summarized in the Other Approaches section at the end of this document and will be formally explored within the next quarter. Unlike the strategic energy plan, which established the overall long-term goals for energy consumption and electricity generation in the Commonwealth, this action plan selects specific strategies achievable in the short term (1-2 years), breaking those strategies down into feasible incremental steps.

A key aim of the CASAREM initiative is the proposed development of a cross-border electrical interconnection linking all four countries to facilitate the transfer of surplus power from the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan, southwards to Afghanistan and Pakistan. The first phase of CASAREM is to establish the necessary transmission and trading infrastructure and systems to enable a trade of 1000 to 1300 MW of electricity between Central Asia and South Asia, and referred to as “CASA-1000”. The purpose of this ESIA/ESMP is to use existing relevant environmental and social information for the CASA 1000 project and assess project impacts and proposed mitigation and management measures. A key part of the ESIA/ESMP is the purchase of new 6 m resolution satellite imagery for the entire CASA 1000 route to augment existing baseline information. No new field investigations were conducted at this feasibility stage due to a variety of reasons including timing, logistics, feasibility and security. Specific objectives of this ESIA/ESMP are to: - Produce one document summarizing all environmental and social information available for the CASA 1000 project; - Evaluate project related social and environmental impacts and their associated mitigation measures; - Produce environmental and social alignment sheets that document environmental and social concerns along the entire 1200 km ROW corridor of the CASA-1000 project; - Identify data gaps at this project feasibility stage; - Prepare a feasibility-level environmental and social management plan that will form part of construction contract documents and form the basis of more detailed ESMPs that will follow during design and construction stages; - Provide guidance on public consultation for the CASA-1000 project during the summer of 2011; and, - Prepare a generic framework for Land Acquisition and Resettlement Plan for each of the four CASAREM countries and the preparation of individual plans once final route selection has been decided.",https://policy.asiapacificenergy.org/node/2346,Multilateral,Other,Power,Power,APEP

Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) Rules and Regulation on Thailand's Solar Rooftop Programme,2013,THAILAND,"A solar rooftop programme supports deployment of rooftop PV by providing a full feed-in tariff granted for duration of 25 years starting from the scheduled commercial operation date (SCOD). The aim is to reduce the state's investment burden, generating more electricity, trimming power usage at load center, and raise the country's power security. It is a change of rate structure of Thailand Feed-in Tariff policy, from adder to fixed FiT, reflecting the idea of Thai government to make renewable energy investment less risk for both developer and have fair price for end user. Up to 2014, the fixed Feed-in Tariff policy is mostly applied to solar energy. ---Note: “VSPP Applicant” or “VSPP” means a person who intends to generate electricity from a solar PV rooftop system and sell that power to the Power Distributor, with a sale capacity of up to 10 MW; “SCOD” means scheduled commercial operation date.",https://policy.asiapacificenergy.org/node/6,National,"Programme, Rule/Regulation",Power,"Power, Renewable, Solar",APEP
