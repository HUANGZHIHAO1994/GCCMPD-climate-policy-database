Kuwait National Implementation Plan to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants,2021.0,Kuwait,"This National Implementation Plan is a nationwide sectoral document aiming at (i) describing the actions that Kuwait has undertaken regarding the inventory, management, and reduction of the presence of POPs; (ii) proposing actions that Kuwait will undertake in order to manage and eliminate POPs, as well as for preventing these chemicals from entering the environment; (iii) informing the Conference of the Parties and Kuwait’s stakeholders about the national initiatives and projects designed to meet the requirements of the Stockholm Convention. The overall objective of the sound management of POPs and hazardous chemicals, is to strengthen the national capacity and capability to deliver a comprehensive assessment of the threats posed by chemicals, reduce and where possible, eliminate the exposure of the populations and the environment, to POPs and hazardous chemicals. Consequently, it is necessary to (i) eliminate or reduce POPs releases; (ii) carry out environmentally sound management of stockpiles of POPs containing wastes and contaminated sites that pose risks to human health and the environment; (iii) integrate environmental considerations and pollution prevention into the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) of the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.

The sea is one of the most important identity marks of Portugal. A healthy ocean is a fundamental condition for Portuguese society to benefit from, including the sustainable, circular and inclusive blue economy. In a decade marked by the imperative of global threats, such as climate change, loss of biodiversity and ecosystem integrity, new forms of pollution and ocean acidification, Portugal is called to play an active role in the search for global solutions. Scientific research allows us to identify ways to protect vulnerable species and ecosystems, safeguard cultural heritage and optimize economic activities, working as an engine for innovation, which is fundamental for economic development and job creation. The security dimension is crucial to respond to threats, preventing and acting in situations that put the marine environment, economic activities and human life at sea at risk. Thus, the vision of this strategy is based on promoting a healthy ocean to enhance sustainable blue development, the well-being of the Portuguese. Strategic objectives for the decade: Portugal and the world are facing major global challenges today and in the next 10 years.

Scientists and environmentalists note deteriorating hydrological, hydrochemical and hydrobiological regime of the Dniester River, 80-percentage decrease over the past 7-8 years in the potential for self-cleaning (the river is no longer capable of self-cleaning), the disappearance of valuable fish species, intensive siltation of the river, a sharp drop in volume, debit and level of water, replacement of plants characteristic of rivers with plants, characteristic of marshes and wetlands, and many other problems indicating the risk that our citizens will soon be left without a source of drinking water, while catastrophic environmental consequences can become irreversible not only for Republic of Moldova, but also for Ukraine. Parliament expresses deep concern about Kiev's intention to establish and put in operation of new turbines and expansion of the Novodnistrovsk pump-storage hydroelectric power plant, as well as the planned construction on the Dniester of a cascade of six hydroelectric power plants, which we consider disastrous for the Republic of Moldova.

The basis for the promotion of the International Standard Global G.A.P., considering growth of agricultural exports from Tajikistan, is the possibility of access to alternative markets with high purchasing power. Most shopping centers (supermarkets) of the United States, Europe and Asia are tightening quality and safety requirements for agricultural products and require traceability of their production technology. The Government of the Republic of Tajikistan creates favorable conditions for increasing the competitiveness of domestic products on the internal and external markets, increase the volume of exports and reduce the share of imported products for the development of the agricultural sector.  However, taking into account existing opportunities related to consumers of international markets, to strengthen the development of exports requires adoption of additional measures. One of the unresolved issues of export growth is ensuring the traceability and compliance of agricultural commodities produced in the country with food safety standards. In the highly competitive international markets availability of a certificate of the International Standard Global G.A.P. will allow to confirm the compliance of Tajikistan's products with all food safety requirements, which will contribute to the growth of consumer demand. Resolution of the following task shall be required for the introduction of the International Standard Global G.A.P.: (a) increasing the level of knowledge of producers and involved government agencies related to the requirements of the International Standard Global G.A.P.; (b) assessment and analysis of legislation for compliance with the requirements of International Standard Global G.A.P., taking into account the analysis of existing practices of implementation of the terms and conditions, and requirements (sanitary and hygienic standards, health and safety, protection of the environment, water and soil, industrial waste management and others); (c) development of the national guidelines for interpreting requirements of the International Standard Global G.A.P.; (d) development of incentives for manufacturers planning to introduce the Global G.A.P. standard and producers holding Global G.A.P. certificates, and also producers who are certified to the International Standard Global G.A.P., (as well as HACCP and ISO) or have contracts for certification work; (e) assessment and development of measures to improve the capacity of the national quality infrastructure (development of procedures for Global G.A.P. certification, accreditation of local body and/or accreditation of local laboratories, training of consultants and auditors); and (f) coordination with the Secretariat of the International Standard Global G.A.P.

Law No.12 of 2020 regulating Public Private Partnerships (PPP).,2020.0,Qatar,"This Law consisting of 30 articles aims at providing a legislative framework for regulating the private sector’s contribution to the implementation of major development projects. The Law outlines that partnerships between the Government and the private sector will be executed as per the following provisions (i) Allocation of lands through a lease or a usufruct, for development by the Private Sector; (ii) Build - Operate -Transfer (BOT); (iii) Build – Transfer - Operate (BTO); (iv) Build – Own - Operate -Transfer (BOOT); (v) Operation and Maintenance; and (vi) any other model adopted by the Council of Ministers upon the proposal of the Minister. The PPP Law indicates that a public entity, such as a Ministry, identifies a project it would like to implement through a PPP model and recommends it to the Minister of Commerce and Industry for approval in principle (art.4). Then the public entity prepares and develops a detailed report on the project to be submitted to the Prime Minister, together with Minister’s recommendations (art.5). After the Prime Minister approval, the Minister of the lead public entity forms a Project Committee, which oversees the developing of two main documents: the Project Policy Document (art.6) and the  Project Business Case (art.7). Once both documents are approved by the Prime Minister’s Office, the public entity and Project Committee will prepare and circulate a prospectus for potential bidders, which includes all project contract details. The PPP Law provides that all tenders be published in local or international newspapers, or on their websites. The Law also requires all opportunities be posted to the unified website for government procurement in Qatar (art.8). Article 12 establishes that the selection of a successful bidder must be subject to the principles of transparency, free competition, and equality of opportunity and treatment. The Prime Minister may cancel the bidding process if (i) only one bid is submitted (or only one bid is left after excluding ineligible bids); (ii) all bids are accompanied by reservations or conditions that are inconsistent with the terms and conditions of the Prospectus or cannot be evaluated; (iii) other cases specified in the prospectus; or (iv) the public interest so requires (art.14).
