Act No. 183 concerning the organizational and functional restructuring of land conservation.,1989.0,Italy,"Despite its title, this landmark statute provides the mechanisms for the implementation of a policy of integrated management of land and allied water resources, primarily in a non-urban context, and the institutional arrangements needed to administer and operate such mechanisms (sect. 1). It was enacted largely in response to the state of divided and compartmentalized responsibilities of the central, regional, and local governments in the management of the above-mentioned natural resources. It is worth noting that for the first time in Italian legislation the river basin is accepted as the basic unit for land and water resources management. The basic mechanism for integrated land and water resources management is the river basin plan. For purposes of river basin planning and of plan implementation, 11 river basins have been designated as having ""national significance"" (sect. 14), and 18 as ""interregional"" basins (sect. 15). All the remaining river basins are classified as ""regional"" (sect. 16). A river basin plan is to be prepared in respect of each ""national"" and ""interregional"" basin (sects. 18 and 19), while ""regional"" basins may be dealt with on an individual basis or grouped together (sect. 20). Detailed rules govern the formation of plans for national and interregional river basins, with particular attention paid to collaboration between the Central and the Regional Governments involved, and to the participation of the public. Plans for national river basins are adopted by the responsible River Basin Authority, while ""interregional"" plans are adopted separately by each Region concerned (sects. 18 and 19).",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/act-no-183-concerning-the-organizational-and-functional-restructuring-of-land-conservation-lex-faoc005724/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3603,"Land & soil, Water", Legislation,"Freshwater resources management,Basic legislation,Institution,Classification/declassification,Soil conservation/soil improvement,Policy/planning,River basin institution,EIA,Basin/catchment/watershed","Alps, Europe, EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA, European Union Countries, Mediterranean, Southern Europe",,ECOLEX_Legislation

DENR Administrative Order No. 01 of 1989: Revised Industrial Tree Plantations Regulations.,1989.0,Philippines,"The Administrative Order, made under Presidential Decree No.705 as amended, prescribes the terms of leases for industrial tree plantations (ITP) and the conditions and procedures for granting them. ITPs are defined as areas of forest land planted to tree crops for industrial and energy uses (sect. 3[a]). Areas that may be leased for ITPs are essentially bare or grass- or brush-covered areas (sect. 4), but not including areas reserved for public purposes, areas to be reforested by concessionaires or adequately-stocked logged-over areas (sect. 5). (Up to 30 percent of an ITP may be adequately-stocked logged-over areas where justified by contiguity to poorly stocked areas (sect. 29). The area of a lease is limited to the amount, up to 20 000 hectares, that the lessee can develop in 5 years. Areas larger than 20 000 hectares may be leased on the basis of exellent performance (sect. 6). The ITP lease is for 25 years, renewable at the option of the lessee for another 25 years (sect. 8). In the first three years the lessee is required to plant 30 percent of the area, reaching 100 percent in five years (sect. 26). The obligations of the lessee are spelled out in part in the regulations,in part in the standard lease appended to the regulations as Annex C, and in part in the comprehensive development and management plan that the lessee is required to submit during the first year of the lease (sect. 14). The basic obligations of the lessee is to 'plant and raise trees' (Annex C(1)). Although the stated purpose of the ITP includes energy-supply, presumably through fast-growing species, the lease requires 'at least sixty (60) surviving seedlings of suitable dipterocarp species per hectare of the area after three (3) years from the start of land development' (Annex C(19). Both the regulation and standard lease restricts cutting on river banks (sect. 40; Annex C(19). Unique, rare and endangered trees must be protected (Annex C(19)). Five edible fruit-trees must be planted on every hectare to sustain wildlife (Annex C(19). Enrichment planting may be required where natural trees are cut (sect. 30).",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/denr-administrative-order-no-01-of-1989-revised-industrial-tree-plantations-regulations-lex-faoc003533/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3605,Forestry, Regulation,"Private forest,Contract/agreement,Timber extraction/logging,Afforestation/reforestation,Fuelwood,Land clearing,Non-timber products,Public forest,Right of use,Planting material/seeds,Community management,Forest management/forest conservation","Asia, ASIA AND THE PACIFIC, East Asian Seas, North Pacific, South-Eastern Asia",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Loi nº 47/1988 portant organisation du régime forestier.,1988.0,Rwanda,"La présente loi, portant organisation du régime forestier, comporte six chapitres, à savoir: Dispositions générales (I); Domaine forestier (II); Conservation des forêts et exploitation forestière (III); Arborisation (IV); Police forestière et dispositions pénales (V) et Dispositions transitoires et finales (VI). Le premier chapitre regroupe les instruments institutionnels nécessaires à la planification et à l'exécution de l'action forestière; plans forestiers, service forestier, commission des forêts, fonds forestier et inventaire forestier. La planification est prévue au double plan national et communal. Pour l'exécution de ces plans, la gestion du domaine forestier de l'Etat et la conservation du milieu naturel, la loi crée un service forestier au sein du ministère chargé des forêts, dont l'organisation et les attributions sont définies par voie réglementaire. De plus, dans chaque préfecture, est prévue une commission des forêts. Il est créé un fonds forestier national, dans lequel sont versées les recettes de l'Etat produits par la forêt et qui est destiné au financement de diverses opérations forestières (reboisements, pépinières, recherche, expérimentation, vulgarisation, etc.). Enfin, il est spécifié que le Ministre chargé des forêts devra tenir un inventaire forestier. Le deuxième chapitre traite ensuite du domaine forestier en ses différentes composantes: domaine forestier de l'Etat, domaine forestier communal et domaine forestier privé. Le domaine forestier de l'Etat s'étend pratiquement sur l'ensemble de l'espace naturel, à l'exception du domaine public fluvial, portant des espèces ligneuses autres qu'agricoles ou nécessitant des reboisements à des fins de conservation ou de restauration du milieu. Le domaine forestier communal est constitué des terrains boisés par la commune, des terrains forestiers de l'Etat cédés par lui à la commune et des terrains nécessitant des reboisements classés au nom de la commune. Le domaine forestier privé comprend les exploitations forestières des particuliers. La loi fixe les procédures de classement et de déclassement des terrains dans ces domaines. En principe, le domaine de l'Etat est géré en régie directe par le service forestier et celui des communes par ces dernières sous le contrôle du service forestier. Moyennant des contrats ou des autorisations, la gestion peut être cependant transférée à des tiers, l'administration forestière gardant en toute hypothèse le contrôle des opérations et veillant au respect des plans d'aménagement, ceux ci devant être établis normalement pour toute unité forestière, même privée, dès lors que celle ci s'étend sur deux hectares au moins. Le troisième chapitre réglement divers aspects de l'exploitation et de la conservation des forêts: coupes des arbres, prélèvement des produits forestier, défrichement, protection du sol et des peuplements. Y sont notamment réglementés les permis requis pour l'exploitation: de coupe, de défrichement et de transport. Permis de coupe et de défrichement donnent lieu à la perception de taxes qui, avec la vente des produits forestiers de l'Etat, constituent les principales recettes du Fonds forestier. Au titre de la protection, outre les mesures tendant à prévenir les feux de brousse, la loi se soucie d'assurer la conservation des sols. L'originalité du quatrième chapitre réside dans le fait qu'il institue un régime d'arborisation, en complément à celui du reboisement. Il s'agit là d'un instrument juridique propre à développer les plantations forestières sur des terres agricoles, dans un pays où les espaces libres de cultures sont rares et où il existe un besoin urgent d'arbres, tant pour protéger les sols que pour produire du bois.

Celle-ci se compose de treize sections, traitant respectivement des institutions de protection et de gestion de l'environnement; des études d'impact sur l'environnement; des déchets; des rejets dans l'atmosphère, dans les eaux et dans les sols; des produits chimiques et matières radioactives dangereux pour l'environnement; des travaux, ouvrages et aménagements susceptibles de porter atteinte aux milieux aquatiques et aux sols; des bruits et nuisances; des installations classées pour la protection de l'environnement; des dispositions communes à la prévention des pollutions et nuisances; de la protection de la faune et de la flore et des espaces naturels et des sites; des risques industriels et naturels majeurs; des dispositions pénales; et enfin des dispositions finales. La loi couvre donc un large champ, mais elle n'est pas pour autant exhaustive, car certains domaines connexes, comme l'urbanisme, la pêche, la chasse, les parcs et réserves, sont régis par d'autres textes.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/loi-no-88-14-instituant-code-de-lenvironnement-lex-faoc005749/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3615,Environment gen., Legislation,"Basic legislation,Institution,EIA,Waste disposal,Hazardous substances,Special fund,Contract/agreement,Offences/penalties,Air quality/air pollution,Freshwater quality/freshwater pollution,Noise pollution,Pollution control,Soil pollution/quality,Polluter pays principle,Hazardous waste","Africa, AFRICA FAO, Least Developed Countries, North Atlantic, Western Africa",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Acquisition or leasing of land for national forests is subject to normal provisions for compensation. Previously, compensation was not usually paid in respect of areas put into forest reserves, although a part of any timber royalties was given to chiefdom authorities.

Su delimitación se efectúa sobre la base de diferentes criterios: divisiones administrativas, condiciones agroecológicas, uso del suelo, infraestructuras, etc. Los distritos cuentan con un Comité Directivo encargado de la coordinación, concertación, gestión y apoyo a los productores rurales. El mismo está compuesto por los representantes de las administraciones interesadas y de organizaciones profesionales. Dicho Comité cuenta a su vez con un Comité Técnico, concebido como instrumento de apoyo para reforzar las capacidades técnicas del distrito. El Comité Técnico está presidido por el Jefe del Distrito e integrado por representantes de los sectores público, semipúblico y privado.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/distritos-de-desarrollo-rural-lex-faoc003871/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3639,Agricultural & rural development, Regulation,"Policy/planning,Institution,Agricultural development,Agricultural land,Capacity building,Agroecology","Americas, Central America, East Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN FAO, North Atlantic, North Pacific, North-East Pacific",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Ley Nº 3/1987 - Ley sobre tierras de regadío.,1987.0,Spain,"Son varios los motivos que condujeron a la promulgación de esta Ley. Primero: dar aplicación al principio de la función social de la propiedad que sanciona la Constitución y que no se cumple en ciertas sierras de regadío. Segundo, existe una baja producción en estas sierras en relación con sus posibilidades técnicas la cual debe aumentarse mediante el incremento de la producción por hectárea y una utilización mayor de personal. Tercero, las nuevas transformaciones de secano en regadío imponen la necesidad de fijar criterios de carácter estable que permitan una redistribución de la tierra a los campesinos. En el articulo primero se definen las sierras de regadío como ""la superficie que, estando bajo una misma linde, tenga realizadas las obras necesarias para conducir el agua a la misma"". Esta nueva disposición legal asigna obligaciones especificas a los propietarios y otros titulares de derechos reales de sierras de regadío ;o como es la de presentar una declaración de sus datos y circunstancias durante un plazo de tres meses contados desde s la expedición de la Ley y la de pagar un impuesto anual, cuando las sierras han sido declaradas como regadíos infrautilizados. Se califican como tierras de ""regadío infrautilizado"" aquellas superficies que han sido transformadas; mediante la realización de obras hidráulicas efectuadas por cualquier administración pública sobre las que haya recaído declaración de puesta en riego o autorización oficial para el mismo y no cumplan con las obligaciones impuestas par la Ley y aquellas que han sido transformadas por iniciativa privada y que tampoco cumplen con las obligaciones impuestas por la Ley. Por decreto del Consejo de Gobierno de la Junta de Extremadura se determina para cada zona o comarca la unidad mínima de cultivo, la cual tendrá una superficie que permita obtener una producción final igual a la cantidad que represente el importe de tres veces y media el salario mínimo interprofesional. Para evaluar la superficie de regadío se establecen los índices de utilización del suelo, de rendimiento y de utilización de mano de obra a cuyo cálculo se llega mediante la aplicación de fórmulas que aparecen en los anejos de la Ley. Para llevar a efecto los propósitos de esta Ley, se crea una institución de carácter administrativo denominada ""Registro Especial de Tierras de Regadío"" y se establece un plan de intensificación de tierras de regadío prohibiéndose cualquier división de la superficie inferior a la unidad mínima de cultivo. El ""Censo de Tierras de Regadío Infrautilizado"" es otra de las innovaciones de esta Ley. Para exonerar del Censo una propiedad clasificada como de regadío infrautilizado y consecuentemente sujeta al impuesto, el titular puede lograrlo mediante la promoción de un expediente de extinción, una vez. que éste haya acreditado el cumplimiento del Plan de Intensificación. Asimismo se autoriza la expropiación de estas tierras que pueden ser distribuidas entre aquellos que reúnen los requisitos que la misma Ley señala. La nueva Ley contiene tres anejos. El primero de ellos establece las normas para el cálculo de la producción agraria. El cálculo de la producción final se define como el valor en pesetas obtenido de restar de la producción total (PT) el valor de los productos reempleados (R) en la explotación del suelo. En el anejo II se fijan las normas para la clasificación de las tierras de regadío indicándose los diferentes factores limitantes para los suelos tales como: la pedregosidad, la permeabilidad, el relieve y la topografía del suelo; la profundidad que puede ser explorada y utilizada par el sistema radicular de las plantas normalmente cultivadas, e incluso en último término, par las plantas espontáneas utilizables. El anejo III contiene el índice: 1) de utilización del suelo que se obtiene dividiendo la suma de la superficie que ha sido objeto de aprovechamiento par algún cultivo de regadío durante el año par la superficie total de regadío; 2) de rendimiento el cual se obtiene teniendo en consideración los índices de rendimiento de coda cultivo realizados en la superficie de regadío, definidos como el coeficiente entre el rendimiento realmente obtenido en cada cultivo y el rendimiento potencial de cada una de ellos; y 3) de utilización de la mano de obra en el cual se toman como tal las horas de mano de obra utilizadas en la superficie de regadío expresadas en hectáreas.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/ley-no-31987-ley-sobre-tierras-de-regadio-lex-faoc003601/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3643,Land & soil, Legislation,"Land reform,Cadastre/land registration,Survey/mapping,Agricultural land,Land commission,Soil conservation/soil improvement,Soil rehabilitation","Europe, EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA, European Union Countries, Mediterranean, North Atlantic, North-East Atlantic, Southern Europe",,ECOLEX_Legislation

The intent of the Legislature in enacting this Chapter is to support the multilateral and bilateral free and fair trade negotiation process currently in place, but to provide California agricultural parties at interest with additional support through state involvement and unified statistical data compilation and analysis to contribute to a more effective and persuasive presentation of cases brought by California agricultural interests.
