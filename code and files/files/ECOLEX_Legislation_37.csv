Loi nº 1-02 portant Code forestier.,1985.0,Burundi,"Cette loi porte Code forestier. Elle est formée par 194 articles répartis en 7 titres, à savoir: Du domaine forestier de l'Etat, des communes et des établissements publics (I); Des boisements des particuliers (II); De la conservation des forêts, boisements et terrains à boiser en général (III); De la répression des infractions (V); Des forêts de protection, réserves forestières, lutte contre l'érosion (V); Des périmètres de reboisement (VI); Dispositions finales(VII). Le Code forestier nait de l'exigence de définir le cadre juridique dans ce domaine en fournissant un ensemble cohérent de dispositions, comprennant des points auparavant non évoqués. Après avoir définit le domaine forestier et avoir précisé les conditions de sa délimitation, le Code classe les forêts naturelles dans le domaine de l'Etat mais en précisant qu'elles sont inaliénables, impresciptibles et insaisissables à titre définitif et sans exception possible, tandis que les boisements du domaine privé de l'Etat, des communes et des établissements publics sont aliénables sans recourrir aux procédures de désaffection, selon les conditions d'aliénation, d'aquisition et d'échange prévues par le Code (art.8). Seuls les terrains que les établissements publics ont reçu en dotation gratuite de l'Etat doivent retourner au domaine de l'Etat quand ces établissements n'en ont plus l'usage. Pour ce qui est de l'exploitation forestière, tous les boisements et les forêts du domaine de l'Etat sont assujettis à un aménagement réglé. L'exploitation peut être faite soit en régie par l'administration forestière soit par des particuliers. Le Code organise la publicité des ventes des coupes de bois et précise aussi: l'assiette des coupes, le marquage des arbres réservés, le contrôle des exploitations et les opérations de récolement. Les boisements importants (superficie supérieure à 10 hectares) appartenant aux particuliers ou aux établissements publics doivent être gérés selon un plan agréé par l'administration. Les articles de 38 à 44 et 56 et 57 portent les procédures à suivre pour affranchir les forêts et les boisements de tous les droits d'usage. En matière de protection, le Code interdit le défrichement dans les forêts et boisements de l'Etat et codifie les cas de défrichement permis dans ceux des communes ou des particuliers. Les feux sont répartis en trois catégories: feux de culture, feux de pâturage et feux sauvages et, pour chaque catégorie sont précisées les conditions d'exercice, les dates de mise à feu, les autorisations et les sanctions. Pour ce qui est de la recherche et de la poursuite des infractions, le Code précise le rôle joué par l'administration forestière dans l'exercice du contencieux forestier et lui donne explicitement le droit de transiger avant ou après le jugement. Au sujet de la protection de la nature, le Code porte des dispositions relatives aux réserves forestières, aux forêts de protection et à la protection de terrains de montagne (mise en défens des pâturages et création des périmètres de conservation des sols). Enfin, une réglementation est prévue pour la création des périmètres de reboisement, pour assurer l'amélioration et la protection de la production des matériels de reproduction des essences forestières et pour contrôler l'introduction de ces matériels.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/loi-no-1-02-portant-code-forestier-lex-faoc002166/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3672,Forestry, Legislation,"Forest management/forest conservation,Framework law,Basic legislation,Policy/planning,Public forest,Timber extraction/logging,Private forest,Traditional rights/customary rights,Land clearing,Forest fires,Protection forest,Mountain area,Afforestation/reforestation,Erosion,Forestry protection measures,Protected area,Offences/penalties,Planting material/seeds","Africa, AFRICA FAO, Eastern Africa, Landlocked Developing Countries, Least Developed Countries",,ECOLEX_Legislation

A greater degree of State intervention in this sector is therefore necessary. Exports of pine roundwood and chips are subject to authorization.

Loi nº 1-82 d'orientation en matière des eaux et des forêts.,1982.0,Gabon,"Cette loi porte dispositions générales formant le régime de base en matière des eaux et des forêts. Elle est formée par 118 articles répartis en 8 titres, à savoir: Dispositions générales (I); Domaine forestier (II); Faune sauvage (III); Ressources halieutiques (IV); Dispositions économiques et financières (V); Dispositions diverses (VI); Dispositions répressives (VII); Dispositions finales (VIII). La politique en matière des eaux et des forêts a pour objectif général de promouvoir une gestion rationnelle des ressources des domaines forestier, fluvial, lacustre et maritime et de la faune sauvage. Cette politique est mise en oeuvre par l'administration des eaux et des forêts, qui est une administration paramilitaire. Le domaine forestier comprend les forêts domaniales classées qui constituent le domaine à vocation forestière permanente et font partie du domaine public et les forêts protégées qui font partie du domaine privé. Les forêts classées, auxquelles appartiennent les diverses catégories arrêtées par l'article 11, doivent couvrir au moins 40 pour-cent de la superficie totale du territoire national. Chacune de ces forêts doit faire l'objet d'un plan d'aménagement. A l'exception de l'exercice des droits d'usage, l'exploitation et la récolte des produits forestiers nécessitent d'une autorisation et d'un titre d'exploitation. Pour des fins de gestion le domaine forestier est divisé en zones, la première étant réservée au nationaux pour l'exploitation. Les permis forestiers attribués à un même exploitant ne peuvent pas dépasser le seuil de 200.000 hectares. En matière d'aménagement, de protection et de conservation de la faune, on distingue, d'une part les aires d'exploitation rationnelle de la faune (réserves naturelles intégrales, sanctuaires, parcs nationaux, réserves de faune, jardins zoologiques et domaines de chasse) et, d'autre part la zone protégée d'exploitation de la faune, à l'intérieur de laquelle la chasse est autorisée et réglementée. La concession des aires d'exploitation rationnelle est interdite, toutefois l'exploitation des activités touristiques à l'intérieur des parcs et des domaines de chasse est autorisée et doit être exercée en exclusive par les guides de chasse. L'article 46 arrête la liste des activités interdites dans ces aires. Les articles de 49 à 66 portent dispositions relatives à l'exercice de la chasse, aux méthodes de chasse, au régime des permis et des licences et à la détention, la circulation et la commercialisation des produits de la chasse des animaux sauvages vivants et des trophées et dépouilles. Le titre IV (art. de 68 à 78) intitulé ""des ressources halieutiques"" comprend des dispositions relatives à la pêche maritime et à la pêche continentale. Tout type de pêche nécessite d'une autorisation préalable, dont la délivrance est subordonnée à l'évaluation préalable des stocks existants. La pêche continentale et celle à l'intérieur des trois milles à partir de la côte est réservée à la pêche artisanale; une redevance spéciale est due par les ressortissants étrangers qui se livrent à la pêche dans ces zones. L'exploitation des ressources halieutiques par des non-nationaux s'effectue dans le cadre des entreprises conjointes de pêche industrielle ou artisanale. Pour pouvoir être mis en vente, les produits de la pêche et de l'aquaculture doivent obtenir un certificat d'origine délivré par l'administration des eaux et des forêts.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/loi-no-1-82-dorientation-en-matiere-des-eaux-et-des-forets-lex-faoc008379/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3708,"Fisheries, Forestry, Water, Wild species & ecosystems", Legislation,"Authorization/permit,Basic legislation,Marine fisheries,Inland fisheries,Enforcement/compliance,Fishing authorization,Foreign fishing,Aquaculture,Alien species,Fishery management and conservation,Access-to-information,Public forest,Timber extraction/logging,Processing/handling,Forest management/forest conservation,Biodiversity,Policy/planning,Protected area,Non-governmental entity,Management/conservation,Hunting/capture,Hunting authorization/permit,Offences/penalties,Inventory,Traditional rights/customary rights,Forest service/forest officers,Classification/declassification","Africa, AFRICA FAO, Central Africa, North Atlantic, South Atlantic",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Act No. 9/II/82 on the Agricultural Reform.,1982.0,Cabo Verde,"This Act establishes the general bases of the Agricultural Reform. The first part deals with a historical view of Cape Verdean life illustrating the different and traditional ways of exploiting agriculture, livestock and all other resources. The Act establishes the bases for the organization and accomplishment of the agricultural reform. It is divided into 7 chapters as follows: Introduction (1); Fundamental principles (2); Transformation of agricultural structures (3); Guarantee of land usufruct rights (4); Agricultural development (5); Agricultural reform organs (6); Transitional provisions (chap. 7). Chapter 1 defines: landowner, rural lessee, leasing, direct and indirect exploitation, sharecropping, rural welling, agricultural producer, rural workmen, agricultural production unit, etc. Chapter 2 regards the transformation of agricultural structures with a view to increasing and improving agricultural productivity and workmen's conditions through the promotion of: usufruct and exploitation rights for land workers; agricultural associations, cooperatives in particular; agricultural reorganization; social and cultural enhancement of rural communities, etc. (art. 3). The Agricultural Reform shall be carried out in compliance with national legislation and the National Development Plan. The Government may apply different agricultural reform programs according to the different geo-climatic and social realities (art. 6). Agricultural land categories are specified on the basis of the different categories of rural lands and the different nature of the occupiers and of their use of such lands (art. 7). Chapter 3 deals with the suppression of sharecropping contracts (arts. 8 and 9) and the control of coffee plantations (art. 10). The transfer of agricultural production units is possible only when the exploitation of lands is carried out by non-owners (indirect regime) (arts. 11 and 12). The landowner transferring the agricultural unit has the right to apply for compensation (art. 13). The expropriation of indirectly exploited lands shall be enforced, in case of death or absence of the landowner and in all other cases established under this Act. The expropriation procedure is submitted to the authorities responsible for agricultural reform (arts. 14-20). Compensation will be granted by the Government from the Agricultural Reform Fund. Leases of rural lands which cannot be expropriated are automatically renewed in the prescribed terms, except in cases in which it represents the landowner's only income. This Act also deals with cases of rural lease in the landowner's absence (arts. 23-25). Chapter 4 establishes that agricultural land usufruct of expropriated lands in compliance with Chapter 3 shall be granted to farmers exploiting the lands at the moment of expropriation according to the Law. The Ministry of Rural Development may prohibit the agricultural exploitation of lands suffering from erosion, but in this case, the agricultural exploitation of another land must be guaranteed (art. 26). Articles 26-32 deal with land concessions: agricultural land categories, types of concession, rural land usufruct rights, land division between landowner, lessee, or farmer, partial concession, land usufruct beneficiaries, concession procedures (including tax-free concessions), requirements, etc. Land usufruct rights confer the perpetual right of agricultural exploitation free of tax (art. 33). Articles 33-39 regulate land usufruct rights: transfer upon decease, termination, order of priority for concessions (farmers of non-expropriated land, agricultural cooperatives, various cooperatives managed by workmen, direct farmers who have a smaller land surface than that decided by the competent organs for agricultural reform), etc. Chapter 5 deals with agricultural development measures, such as: improvement of techniques, transport, storage, conservation and distribution; regulation of product trading; farmers' cultural development; organization and development of rural extension and scientific research. The Government shall establish incentives for agricultural production, in particular for the creation of an agricultural credit system; upgrading of machinery; agricultural insurance (against climate and pests); tax incentives, etc. National agricultural producers may benefit from such incentives (art. 41). Chapter 6: the implementation of agricultural reform is to be carried out by the Government, the National Council of Agricultural Reform and the Agricultural Reform Committees. Competencies are specified in articles 44-46, whereas articles 47 and 48 deal with the creation of the Agricultural Reform Fund and the Local Fund for Rural Development. Chapter 7 specifies that rural land transfers are submitted to the Ministry of Rural Development; the State has the priority in the purchase of rural lands; if there is a non-written contract a landowner with a lease contract must notify such transfers to the Agricultural Reform Committee. If the landowner does not notify it within one year, the land shall be converted into national property without compensation. The Government shall regulate the following matters by Ministerial Decree: compensation and expropriation procedures; the statute of rural lands; organization, administration and implementation of the Local Fund for Rural Development.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/act-no-9ii82-on-the-agricultural-reform-lex-faoc008300/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3712,"Agricultural & rural development, Land & soil", Legislation,"Agricultural development,Basic legislation,Land reform,Land tenure,Expropriation,Agricultural land,Right of use,Concession,Lease,Smallholders/peasants","Africa, AFRICA FAO, Atlantic Ocean Islands, North Atlantic, Sahel, Small Island Developing States, Western Africa",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Décret portant règlement des différentes formes d'association ayant la société copérative pour base.,1981.0,Haiti,"Ce décret est un texte organique formé de 47 articles, groupés en huit titres et précédés d'un préambule. Il reprend, mais sans les abroger (sauf dans la mesure où elles lui sont contraires) un bon nombre des dispositions qui ont régi jusqu'ici les coopératives. Son objectif essentiel consiste à faciliter l'essor de la coopération: et ceci suivant trois formules: la société coopérative, l'union des sociétés coopératives (qui peut consister en un regroupement national), la société mixte de développement coopératif (qui comporte l'association de l'Etat haitien aux structures pertinentes). Parmi les moyens à mettre en oeuvre pour réaliser l'objectif précité, le texte fait état de la formation de groupements pré ou para coopératifs et de la réglementation des différentes formes d'association ayant la société coopérative pour base. Les principes généraux qui président à l'organisation des coopératives sont fixés à l'article 6, ainsi qu'il suit: adhésion libre et de base; coopération volontaire des membres; taux d'intérêt limité payable sur les parts sociales; contrôle démocratique (un homme,une voix); ristourne du trop perçu au prorata des affaires traitées; neutralité politique, ethnique et religieuse; réalisation des opérations au comptant; éducation des membres. Les titres de II à VI ont respectivemnt pour objet: l'agrément officiel et l'acte constitutif (II); les sociétaires et le capital social (III); l'entreprise coopérative (IV); les structures internes de contrôle, la liquidation et la dissolution (V et VI). Le titre VII est consacré aux avantages accordés à ces associations par la loi: préférence pour l'affermage de toute terre vacante du domaine privé de l'Etat; exonération du paiement de l'impôt sur le revenu, de certains droits d'accise, de la contribution foncière des propriétés bâties (limitativement à leurs propres locaux), de la patente; franchise douanière à l'importation d'articles nécéssaires à leurs activités; privilège dans le recouvrement de leurs créances. Le titre VIII traite, entre autres, questions de la constitution d'un fonds coopératif commun (art. 35), qui servira de garantie aux emprunts contractés par les associations et sera alimenté tout à la fois par un prélèvement - sur les excédents nets des résultats des exercices annuels - distinct de celui qui servira à constituer le fonds de réserve prévu à l'article 13 et par 50 pourcent de la part revenant à l'Etat sur les excédents nets des sociétés mixtes de développement coopératif. Enfin les coopératives d'épargne et de crédit, appelées communément Caisses populaires, font l'objet des articles 38 à 46; il y est prévu, notamment, le taux plafond des intérêts à payer sur les prêts consentis par les caisses, qui s'élève à 12 pourcent par an.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/decret-portant-reglement-des-differentes-formes-dassociation-ayant-la-societe-coperative-pour-base-lex-faoc007583/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3724,Agricultural & rural development, Regulation,Cooperative/producer organization,"Americas, Caribbean, Latin America and the Caribbean, LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN FAO, Least Developed Countries, North Atlantic, Small Island Developing States",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Regulation respecting the quality of the atmosphere.,1981.0,Canada,"The purpose of this Regulation is to establish ambient air standards and emission standards for particulate matters, vapours and gases, emission opacity standards as well as control measures for the prevention, elimination or reduction of contaminant discharge from stationary sources. Unless specified otherwise, this Regulation applies immediately to new or existing stationary sources. It applies to any part of an existing stationary source that is modified or enlarged even if it is specified elsewhere that it applies subsequently to this existing stationary source. In the case of a furnace used in the metallurgical industry, the particulate matter emission standards provided for in this Regulation apply globally to all emissions related to the operation of this furnace, namely those coming from the loading and casting and those escaping from annular gaps around electrodes. From 1 January 1982, it is forbidden to build or modify a stationary source or to increase the production of a good or of a service whose particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, hydrogen sulfide and lead emissions are liable to increase the concentration of contaminants in the atmosphere beyond the maximum limit provided for in the standards in section 6 or are liable to increase the concentration of a contaminant for which the said standards have already been exceeded. It is forbidden to burn residual materials in the open air, even to recuperate it in part or in whole, except for limbs, trees, dead leaves, explosives and empty containers of explosives. It is forbidden to burn fossil fuels or organic compounds in the open air unless one has been issued a certificate of authorization by the Minister under section 22 of the Act. This section does not apply to industrial flares, nor within the scope of the training given to firemen. Any pot line of any new aluminium smelter cannot emit into the atmosphere more than 1.45 kg of total fluorides per ton of aluminium produced. The processes of an oil refinery or a petrochemical industry comprising the use of a new catalytic cracking unit or a new coke unit must not emit into the atmosphere more than 115 mg of particulate matter per cubic metre of undiluted dry gas, under standard conditions. Any light motor vehicle of a model subsequent to 1985 offered for sale, on display for sale, sold or used in Québec must be equipped with a device in good working order to reduce the emission of hydrocarbons, carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. No one may remove or modify or allow to be removed or modified any device installed in a motor vehicle to reduce or eliminate the emission of a contaminant into the environment, or, in the case of a light motor vehicle equipped with a catalytic converter, modify or allow to be modified the opening of the fuel tank or pour leaded gasoline therein.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/regulation-respecting-the-quality-of-the-atmosphere-lex-faoc191639/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3727,"Air & atmosphere, Environment gen.", Regulation,"Air quality/air pollution,Emissions,Business/industry/corporations,Environmental standards,Pollution control","Americas, Arctic, ASIA AND THE PACIFIC, East Pacific, North America, North Atlantic",,ECOLEX_Legislation
