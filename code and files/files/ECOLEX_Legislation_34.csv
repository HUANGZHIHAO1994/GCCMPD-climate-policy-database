En effet, la dimension sociale vise à responsabiliser les ruraux pour une gestion durable des ressources forestières, fauniques et halieutiques. Cette option reconnaît aux ruraux leur capacité de gérer rationnellement les ressources avec les appuis et les conseils dont ils auraient besoin. Il s’agit pour les ruraux d’acquérir un pouvoir de décision sur les ressources qu’ils envisagent d’exploiter et de conserver. Dans certains contextes particuliers, la Politique forestière nationale vise à associer les populations riveraines et divers opérateurs à cette gestion. Quant à la dimension économique de la Politique Forestière Nationale, elle vise à favoriser et à garantir l’investissement foncier en cofinançant l’investissement initial avec les gestionnaires des ressources, en sécurisant les investissements, mobilisant le financement des programmes nationaux, régionaux et locaux auprès des partenaires.  Enfin, la dimension écologique de la Politique Forestière Nationale vise, d’une part, à préserver la diversité biologique dans ses composantes (diversité génétique, diversité des produits et diversité des paysages), et d’autre part, à restaurer les écosystèmes dans le cadre de la lutte contre la désertification et l’avancée du désert. Pour atteindre ces objectifs la Politique forestière nationale prévoit six (6) axes stratégiques ou composantes, notamment favoriser l’initiative privée et le partenariat; préciser le mode de gestion des ressources aux différentes échelles; améliorer les capacités d’intervention des différents partenaires par un dispositif d’appui-formation-conseil efficace; favoriser l’investissement aux différentes étapes des filières; articuler la gestion des ressources aux différentes échelles spatiales et organisationnelles; et conserver la diversité biologique et restaurer les écosystèmes.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/politique-nationale-forestiere-1995-lex-faoc144899/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3387,"Forestry, Wild species & ecosystems", ,"Forest management/forest conservation,Sustainable use,Financing,Community management,Extension,Capacity building,Biodiversity,Protection forest,Climate change,Non-governmental entity,Special fund,Smallholders/peasants,Processing/handling,Wild fauna,Wild flora,Desertification","Africa, AFRICA FAO, Least Developed Countries, Sahel, Western Africa",,ECOLEX_Legislation

"National Policy for the Conservation and Management of Wetland Resources, 1995",1995.0,Uganda,"This Policy sets the following goals; to establish the principles by which wetland resources can be optimally used now and in the future; to end practices which reduce wetland productivity; to maintain the biological diversity of natural or semi-natural wetlands; to maintain wetland functions and values; and to integrate wetland concerns into the planning and decision making of other sectors. The principles guiding the pursuit of these goals are that wetland resources form an integral part of the environment and their management must be pursued in the context of an interaction between conservation and the national development strategies and activities, wetland conservation can only be achieved through a coordinated and cooperative approach involving all the concerned people and organisations in the country including the local communities and it is of vital importance for wetland conservation and management that the present attitudes and perceptions of Ugandans regarding wetlands be changed. The goals are to be achieved through thirty six policy statements, aimed at ensuring no drainage occurs unless more important environment management requirements supersede; that only non-destructive uses are carried out in and around wetlands; that wetland developments are subject to environmental impact assessment and audit; and maintaining an optimum diversity of uses and users and consideration for other stakeholders when using a wetland. Among the resource problems identified by the Policy, it specifically tries to handle the issues of water loss, reduced runoff control, soil deterioration, crop pest risks, health problems, etc. The policy also provides for the sustainable use of wetlands and provides two strategies to this effect; wetlands may be utilized in such a way that they do not lose traditional benefits presently obtained from them and any decision to use wetlands must consider the requirements of all other users in the community. Strategies are also provided for the environmentally sound management, conservation, water supply and effluent treatment, tenure and use, recovery, environmental impact assessment, research and inventory, developing public awareness, etc. of wetlands.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/national-policy-for-the-conservation-and-management-of-wetland-resources-1995-lex-faoc201563/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3388,"Environment gen., Water, Wild species & ecosystems", ,"Biodiversity,Capacity building,Water shortage/drought,Early warning system/emergency intervention system,Ecosystem preservation,EIA,Environmental planning,Environmental standards,Protection of environment,Wetlands,Freshwater resources management,Governance,Surface water,Water conservation zone,Water quality standards","Africa, AFRICA FAO, Eastern Africa, Landlocked Developing Countries, Least Developed Countries",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Act LV of 1994 on Arable Land.,1994.0,Hungary,"The purpose of this Law is the establishment of market oriented conditions in the agricultural sector based on private ownership. Land transfer and the use of land as guarantee for land-based credit should promote the efficient operation of new businesses. This Law basically regulates the use of arable land and aims to create landed properties suitable for competitive agricultural production, avoiding to burden land with the effects of excessive subdivision. The reduction of agricultural land should remain within reasonable limits and the conservation of land quality should have legal backing. In Chapter I introductory provisions regarding the effect of the Law and definition of terms are set forth. The Law applies to all arable land in the national territory, to the utilization and conservation of land, to the acquisition of landed property and its restrictions and to the creation of plots. The provisions apply to urban land, whether under agricultural or forestry cultivation. Chapter II deals with the acquisition of ownership of arable land by Hungarian and foreign private persons or legal entities. EU citizens enjoy the same rights as Hungarians if they have been living and operating in the field of agriculture for at least 3 years in Hungary, and if they meet certain requisites and undertake some obligations. The Law covers acquisition under any form except: legal inheritance, adverse possession, construction over others' property, expropriation and through auction for compensation purposes. Use of arable lands is provided for in Chapter III. Use rights are regulated in the Civil Code as is the lease of arable land, unless this Law provides otherwise. Chapter IV deals with procedures for the creation of estates (general land reform, voluntary exchange of lands). Provisions on the utilization and protection of arable land are set forth in Chapter V. Cultivation profiles should be respected. Changes in cultivation profiles are to be authorized, otherwise penalties are foreseen. In the light of these purposes, soil conservation has an important role and aims to maintain the productivity and quality of the soil. Soil conservation is provided for in Chapter VI which sets forth State duties, the obligations of land users and provides for soil conservation authorities and their duties.

Ley Nº 54 - Ley de Desarrollo Agrario.,1994.0,Ecuador,"La presente Ley tiene por objeto el fomento, desarrollo y protección integrales del sector agrario. Para la ejecución de la política agraria (cap. IV), mediante el artículo 23, se crea el Instituto Nacional de Desarrollo Agrario (INDA), como entidad de derecho público, con ámbito nacional, personalidad jurídica y patrimonio propio, adscrito al Ministerio de Agricultura y Ganadería. El INDA substituye en sus funciones al Instituto Ecuatoriano de Reforma Agraria (IERAC). Esta Ley, cuyo objetivo general es promover el desarrollo sostenido del sector agrario, dispone, entre otras cosas, que el Gobierno realice programas de capacitación para pequeños agricultores y comunidades indígenas (arts. 4º y 5º) y que los bancos y sociedades financieras del país participen en un plan nacional de concesión de crédito agrícola (art. 9º). La Ley se ocupa también de diferentes cuestiones relativas a la tenencia de tierras rústicas. Se garantiza la propiedad de la tierra que sea eficazmente trabajada, cumpliendo así su función social (art. 17) tal como la define la Ley (art. 18). Está terminantemente prohibida toda forma de trabajo precario en el cultivo de la tierra o formas que impliquen pagos en especie por el uso de la tierra (art. 20). Las tierras así cultivadas podrán expropiarse previo pago de una justa indemnización. Podrán también expropiarse las tierras que se hayan mantenido inexplotadas por más de tres años consecutivos (siempre que no concurran circunstancias atenuantes), así como aquéllas en las que se empleen prácticas de cultivo que atenten gravemente contra la conservación de los recursos naturales renovables (art. 30). Las tierras rústicas de propiedad comunitaria podrán ser objeto de fraccionamiento y de partición entre sus miembros previa resolución adoptada por la mayoría de éstos (art. 22). La transferencia de propiedad de tierras rústicas de dominio privado es libre y no requiere autorización alguna (art. 33). Sin embargo, al objeto de aplicar un control sobre el fraccionamiento de los predios, el Gobierno deberá: (a) establecer el tamaño de ""unidades de producción"" familiar y (b) promover la integración cuando se haya verificado un fraccionamiento excesivo alentando la organización de formas asociativas tanto de servicios como de producción (art. 34). Salvo algunas excepciones (principalmente el INDA) se prohíbe terminantemente a las entidades del sector público ser propietarias de tierras rústicas debiendo enajenar las que ingresaren a su patrimonio en el futuro (art. 35). Sin embargo, el INDA adjudicará tierras que posea o adquiera quedando el adquiriente sujeto al pago de un justo precio (art. 38). Son nulos y de ningún valor los gravámenes constituidos sobre tierras del Estado por quienes para hacerlo se han arrogado falsamente la calidad de propietarios. También lo son las trasmisiones de dominio de dichas tierras fundadas en ""derechos y acciones de sitio"" (art. 35). Se adjudicarán gratuitamente a las poblaciones indígenas las tierras del Estado que han estado en su posesión ancestral. En ellas se respetarán las costumbres vernáculas pero deberán incorporarse los elementos que, según el Gobierno, puedan contribuir a mejorar los sistemas tradicionales de producción (art. 36). Quienes hayan ejercido una tenencia ininterrumpida mínima de cinco años sobre tierras del Estado podrán solicitar al INDA la adjudicación de esas tierras previo pago de un precio justo (art. 37).

Fresh Cut Flowers and Fresh Cut Greens Promotion and Information Act of 1993 (7 USC Ch. 97),1994.0,United States of America,"This act provides for fresh cut flowers and fresh cut greens promotion and information. It states that Congress finds that (1) fresh cut flowers and fresh cut greens are an integral part of life in the United States, are enjoyed by millions of persons every year for a multitude of special purposes (especially important personal events), and contribute a natural and beautiful element to the human environment; (2)(A) cut flowers and cut greens are produced by many individual producers throughout the United States as well as in other countries, and are handled and marketed by thousands of small-sized and medium-sized businesses;  and (B) the production, handling, and marketing of cut flowers and cut greens constitute a key segment of the United States horticultural industry and thus a significant part of the overall agricultural economy of the United States; (3) handlers play a vital role in the marketing of cut flowers and cut greens in that handlers (A) purchase most of the cut flowers and cut greens marketed by producers; (B) prepare the cut flowers and cut greens for retail consumption; (C) serve as an intermediary between the source of the product and the retailer; (D) otherwise facilitate the entry of cut flowers and cut greens into the current of domestic commerce; and (E) add efficiencies to the market process that ensure the availability of a much greater variety of the product to retailers and consumers; (4) it is widely recognized that it is in the public interest and important to the agricultural economy of the United States to provide an adequate, steady supply of cut flowers and cut greens at reasonable prices to the consumers of the United States; (5)(A) cut flowers and cut greens move in interstate and foreign commerce; and (B) cut flowers and cut greens that do not move in interstate or foreign channels of commerce but only in intrastate commerce directly affect interstate commerce in cut flowers and cut greens; (6) the maintenance and expansion of markets in existence on December 14, 1993, and the development of new or improved markets or uses for cut flowers and cut greens, are needed to preserve and strengthen the economic viability of the domestic cut flowers and cut greens industry for the benefit of producers, handlers, retailers, and the entire floral industry; (7) generic programs of promotion and consumer information can be effective in maintaining and developing markets for cut flowers and cut greens, and have the advantage of equally enhancing the market position for all cut flowers and cut greens; (8) because cut flowers and cut greens producers are primarily agriculture-oriented rather than promotion-oriented, and because the floral marketing industry within the United States is comprised mainly of small-sized and medium-sized businesses, the development and implementation of an adequate and coordinated national program of generic promotion and consumer information necessary for the maintenance of markets in existence on December 14, 1993, and the development of new markets for cut flowers and cut greens have been prevented; (9) there exist established State and commodity-specific producer-funded programs of promotion and research that are valuable efforts to expand markets for domestic producers of cut flowers and cut greens and that will benefit from the promotion and consumer information program authorized by this chapter in that the program will enhance the market development efforts of the programs for domestic producers; (10) an effective and coordinated method for ensuring cooperative and collective action in providing for and financing a nationwide program of generic promotion and consumer information is needed to ensure that the cut flowers and cut greens industry will be able to provide, obtain, and implement programs of promotion and consumer information necessary to maintain, expand, and develop markets for cut flowers and cut greens; and (11) the most efficient method of financing such a nationwide program is to assess cut flowers and cut greens at the point at which the flowers and greens are sold by handlers into the retail market. It is the policy of Congress that it is in the public interest, and it is the purpose of this chapter, to authorize the establishment, through the exercise of the powers provided in this chapter, of an orderly procedure for the development and financing (through an adequate assessment on cut flowers and cut greens sold by handlers to retailers and related entities in the United States) of an effective and coordinated program of generic promotion, consumer information, and related research designed to strengthen the position of the cut flowers and cut greens industry in the marketplace and to maintain, develop, and expand markets for cut flowers and cut greens.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/fresh-cut-flowers-and-fresh-cut-greens-promotion-and-information-act-of-1993-7-usc-ch-97-lex-faoc198988/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3437,"Agricultural & rural development, Cultivated plants", Legislation,"Agricultural development,Business/industry/corporations,Financial agricultural measures,Consumer protection,Floriculture,Plant production,Education,Internal trade,International trade,Tax/levy","Americas, Arctic, East Pacific, North America, North Atlantic",,ECOLEX_Legislation

"Loi nº 94/01 portant régime des forêts, de la faune et de la pêche.",1994.0,Cameroon,"La présente loi abroge et remplace sa devancière, adoptée le 27 novembre 1981, qui avait le même objet, à savoir le régime juridique des forêts, de la faune et de la pêche. Il s'agit d'une loi dont les dispositions de base doivent être complétées par une série de textes réglementaires d'application. La loi est fondée sur une approche de gestion intégrée et durable, alliant la conservation et l'utilisation soutenues des ressources et des écosystèmes. Elle se compose des sept titres suivants: (I) dispositions générales; (II) protection de la nature et de la biodiversité ; (III) forêts; (IV) faune; (V) pêche; (VI) répression des infractions ; (VII) dispositions diverses et finales. Le titre II interdit en principe les feux de brousse, soumet le défrichement d'une forêt à son déclassement, subordonne à étude d'impact sur l'environnement les projets de développement susceptibles de perturber le milieu naturel, etc. Il prévoit en outre les modalités de mise en défens ou de classement en aires protégées des zones forestières dont le maintien est nécessaire pour assurer la conservation des sols ou de la biodiversité, la régulation du régime hydrique, etc. Les ressources génétiques du patrimoine national appartiennent à l'Etat et leur utilisation à des fins lucratives donne lieu au paiement de royalties. Le titre III distingue deux grandes catégories de forêts: (i) les forêts permanentes, ou classées, qui sont constituées par les terres définitivement affectées à la forêt et/ou à l'habitat de la faune; et (ii) les forêts non permanentes, ou non classées, qui sont susceptibles d'être affectées à des utilisations autres que forestières. Les forêts permanentes doivent couvrir au moins 30 pour cent du territoire national. Les forêts permanentes se subdivisent elles-mêmes en forêts domaniales et forêts communales. Quant aux forêts non permanentes, elles comprennent trois catégories distinctes de forêts, à savoir: (i) les forêts du domaine national, dont les produits appartiennent en principe à l'Etat et où les droits d'usage peuvent être normalement exercés; (ii) les forêts communautaires, catégorie nouvelle non définie, dont il est cependant précisé que les produits de leur exploitation appartiennent entièrement aux communautés villageoises concernées; (iii) les forêts des particuliers. L'exploitation forestière, qui est subordonnée à un inventaire préalable de la forêt concernée, ne peut être pratiquée que par les personnes physiques ou morales ayant été formellement agréées. Les modalités d'exploitation diffèrent en fonction des catégories de forêts. L'aménagement des forêts est conçu comme englobant les opérations d'inventaire, de reboisement, de régénération, d'exploitation soutenue et de réalisation d'infrastructures. Le financement de ces activités est assuré par le Fonds spécial de développement forestier. Les espèces animales sauvages sont réparties en trois classes: A, intégralement protégée, B et C, partiellement protégées et dont l'exploitation est réglementée. Les procédés et les engins de chasse susceptibles de nuire à la faune sont en principe prohibés. Mise à part la chasse traditionnelle, qui est autorisée sur toute l'étendue du territoire sauf dans les forêts domaniales, tout acte de chasse est subordonné à l'obtention d'un permis ou d'une licence et au paiement des droits et des taxes correspondants. Les ranches de gibier appartiennent à l'Etat, leur gestion peut se faire en régie directe ou en affermage par des organismes spécialisés. Le titre V relatif à la pêche distingue sept moyens d'obtention des ressources halieutiques: la pêche industrielle, la pêche semi-industrielle, la pêche traditionnelle ou artisanale, la pêche sportive, la pêche scientifique, la mariculture et la pisciculture. Sur le plan des principes, le droit de pêche appartient à l'Etat, que ce soit dans le domaine maritime ou dans le domaine fluvial. L'exploitation industrielle des produits halieutiques est subordonnée à l'obtention préalable d'un agrément. Une licence est nécessaire pour l'exercice de la pêche industrielle, tandis que les autres formes de pêche, à l'exception de celle artisanale, requièrent un permis. La délivrance et le renouvellement des licences et des permis donnent lieu à la perception d'une taxe d'exploitation. Des ressources halieutiques, des restrictions peuvent être apportées à la pêche, par décret, en vue d'assurer la protection de la faune et des milieux aquatiques et, également, afin de maintenir la production à un niveau acceptable. L'administration compétente peut interdire la pêche de certaines espèces protégées et fixer des zones ou des secteurs dans lesquels la pêche ne peut être pratiquée. Ces mesures sont complétées par des dispositions relatives à la gestion des installations aquacoles et des établissements de pêche, ainsi qu'à l'inspection sanitaire, au contrôle, au conditionnement et au transport des produits de la pêche. Le titre VI, enfin, traite de la répression des infractions, dont la recherche et la constatation incombent aux agents assermentés des administrations chargées de ces secteurs. Les infractions peuvent en général donner lieu à transaction. Faute de celle-ci, les actions sont engagées contre les accusés devant les tribunaux ordinaires. Les sanctions pénales sont principalement de deux ordres: pécuniaires et/ou privatives de liberté.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/loi-no-9401-portant-regime-des-forets-de-la-faune-et-de-la-peche-lex-faoc004845/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3440,"Fisheries, Forestry, Wild species & ecosystems", Legislation,"Marine fisheries,Basic legislation,Fishery management and conservation,Inland fisheries,Artisanal fishing,Governance,Aquaculture,Offences/penalties,Forestry protection measures,Forest management/forest conservation,Biodiversity,Management/conservation,Wild fauna,Wild flora,Hunting/capture,Hunting rights,Ranching/captive breeding","Africa, AFRICA FAO, Central Africa, North Atlantic",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Decree of the Prime Minister on the Management and Use of Forests and Forest Land (No. 169/PM).,1993.0,"Lao, People's Dem. Rep.","Chapter I of this Decree defines forests as living natural resources ""necessary for the preservation of the environment, water sources, soil, wildlife and the livelihood of the pluri-ethnical population"". Forest lands are all areas under the management of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, whether covered or not by forests, if not used or defined as permanent agricultural land. Forests are declared the property of the State. Individuals, collectives or juridical entities may hold use or tenure rights only by authority of the Ministry. However, the State recognizes the right to use forest land and products in accordance with village customs, such as for the gathering of firewood and other products, hunting, and other customs set forth in detailed regulations at village level. Individuals, etc., using trees, natural forests and forest land are obliged to pay for such resources. All felling of trees is prohibited, except if specifically allowed by Forest Management Plans or authorized by the Ministry. Conversion of forest land to other purposes must be authorized by the Prime Minister, except in the case of conversion of certain degraded lands, which may be authorized by the Land and Forest Land Distribution Committee. Chapter II calls for the delineation of Forest Management Planning Areas and Forest Management Areas. The Ministry is obligated to survey and designate forests according to the following categories: Protection Forests, Conservation Forests, Production Forests, Regenerated Forests and Degraded Forest Lands. Chapter III states that the Ministry shall appoint forestry officers in charge of each forest area. The Ministry is also empowered to contract out management to other parties, such as villagers, collective organizations, individuals or juridical entities. Forest officers are required, in consultation with concerned parties, including villagers, to draw up forest management plans, subject to approval of the Ministry. Such plans must be consistent with the principles of sustainable forest management. Any forest management plan calling for exploitation in a forest area must clearly state the compensatory steps to be taken in order to norma-lize the exploited forest. Chapters IV, V and VI deal with Forest Management Contracts, which include Collective, Family and Afforestation contracts.
