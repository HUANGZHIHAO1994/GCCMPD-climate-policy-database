In order to safeguard real estate rights and statutory interests, the register of real estate contains data on all immovable property in the country, on rights in connection thereto and other relevant information. Certain rights come into being through registration. National land and farm planning, the control of proper use of land and of real estate trade, town and country planning, data collection and the determination of financial obligations are all based on information in real estate registers which are open to public scrutiny. There is a presumption of good faith with regard to the acquisition of rights against payment. The administration of registration matters is the responsibility of land registry offices. General administrative procedural rules should be applied to land registration, taking into account particular cases specified in this Law Decree. District land registries have first-level jurisdiction and county land registries have appellate jurisdiction. Registration activity is carried out by the Minister of Agriculture through the executive committees of county governments. Section II deals with the system of real estate registration. The Law-Decree differentiates between individual and common property, public areas, urban and non-urban land, state-owned property, cooperative's property, jointly-owned block of flats and their common areas. Section III requires that estates be registered with the metric system. Profiles of cultivation of arable and forestry land, namely, arable land, meadow, vineyard, orchards, gardens, pastures, reeds and forest, should all be registered. Likewise, the soil quality of arable, forestry and farmlands should be registered. Uncultivated land is specified in article 42 of the Decree. Section IV lays down provisions regarding the registration of changes in ownership and other rights or facts related to the estate. Documents which can be used for registration purposes are specified in articles 76-87. Section V regards the decisions of district land registry offices regarding requests for the registration of changes.

The competent agricultural (biotechnology) authorities are the sections for agriculture, for plant health, for animal health and for food-production of the Ministry of Agriculture and Regional Development. The environmental and public health authorities (which belong to the Ministry of Environmental Protection and to the Ministry of Health) as special authorities take part in the procedure of the competent agricultural authorities. Importers shall declare to the competent agricultural authority whether the consignment contains or not genetically modified organism or product thereof. The certificate about the result of the detection issued by one of the three detection centers shall be attached to the declaration. The competent agricultural authority may decide the establishment and the size of genetic protection zones, if necessary, which is an isolation distance between those fields where traditional and genetically modified plants are cultivated. The registration of the species could be applied for after receipt of permit of the release from the competent agricultural authority. After the species is registered the permit for the commerciallization can be applied for. In the permit for commercialization the issuing authority must define those products of the plant or of the animal which this permit is also valid for. The competent agricultural authority decides on the scale of production of the permitted gmo. A data-base is established in the Agricultural Biotechnology Center of Godollo for the registration of the permits. In case the production for agricultural purpose is carried out in a contained system the genetically modified animal species shall not be registered. The genetically modified animals are not allowed to be bred and they or their semen are not allowed to be marketed.

Floral Research and Consumer Information Act (7 USC Ch. 74),,United States of America,"This act provides for floral research and consumer information. It states that flowers and plants are an integral part of American life, contributing a natural and beautiful element, especially in urban areas, to what is increasingly a manmade, artificial environment for this country's citizens. Providing comfort and pleasure for many special occasions as well as for everyday living, flowers and plants work against visual pollution and, in the case of green plants, generate oxygen within their environment. The flowers and plants to which this chapter refers are cut flowers, potted flowering plants, and foliage plants. These flowers and plants are produced by many individual producers throughout the United States and in foreign countries. These products move in interstate and foreign commerce, and those that do not move in such channels of commerce directly burden or affect interstate commerce of these products. The maintenance and expansion of existing markets and the development of new or improved markets and uses are vital to the welfare of flower and plant producers, brokers, wholesalers, and retailers throughout the Nation. The floral industry within the United States is comprised mainly of small- and medium-sized businesses. The producers are primarily agriculturally-oriented companies rather than promotion-oriented companies. The development and implementation of coordinated programs of research and promotion necessary for the maintenance of markets and the development of new markets have been inadequate. Without cooperative action in providing for and financing such programs, individual flower and plant producers, wholesalers, and retailers are unable to implement programs of research, consumer and producer information, and promotion necessary to maintain and improve markets for these products. It is widely recognized that it is in the public interest to provide an adequate, steady supply of fresh flowers and plants to the consumers of the Nation. The American consumer requires a continuing supply of quality and affordable flowers and plants as an important element in the quality of life. It is, therefore, declared to be the policy of Congress and the purpose of this chapter that it is essential and in the public interest to authorize the establishment of an orderly procedure for the development and financing, through an adequate assessment, of an effective and coordinated program of research, consumer and producer education, and promotion designed to strengthen the floral industry's position in the marketplace and maintain, develop, and expand markets for flowers, plants, and flowering plants. Nothing in this chapter may be construed to dictate quality standards or provide for control of production or otherwise limit the right of individual flower and plant producers to produce commercial flowers and plants. Nothing in this chapter may be construed as a trade barrier to flowers and plants produced in foreign countries, and this chapter treats foreign producers equitably. To effectuate the declared policy of this chapter, the Secretary shall, subject to the provisions of this chapter, issue and, from time to time, may amend orders applicable to persons engaged in production, sale, importation, or handling of flowers and plants. Such orders shall be applicable to all production or marketing areas, or both, in the United States. Whenever the Secretary has reason to believe that the issuance of an order will tend to effectuate the declared policy of this chapter, the Secretary shall give due notice and opportunity for hearing upon a proposed order. Such hearing may be requested and a proposal for an order submitted by an organization certified pursuant to section 4315 of this chapter, or by any interested person affected by the provisions of this chapter, including the Secretary.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/floral-research-and-consumer-information-act-7-usc-ch-74-lex-faoc198969/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3850,"Cultivated plants, General", Legislation,"Consumer protection,Floriculture,Research,Access-to-information,Urban and peri-urban agriculture,Plant production,Internal trade,International trade,Agricultural development","Americas, Arctic, East Pacific, North America, North Atlantic",,ECOLEX_Legislation
Farmland Protection Policy Act (7 USC Ch. 73),,United States of America,"This act provides for farmland protection policy.

Public Rangelands Improvement (43 USC Ch. 37),,United States of America,"This chapter provides for public rangelands improvement. It states that the Congress finds and declares that (1) vast segments of the public rangelands are producing less than their potential for livestock, wildlife habitat, recreation, forage, and water and soil conservation benefits, and for that reason are in an unsatisfactory condition; (2) such rangelands will remain in an unsatisfactory condition and some areas may decline further under present levels of, and funding for, management; (3) unsatisfactory conditions on public rangelands present a high risk of soil loss, desertification, and a resultant underproductivity for large acreages of the public lands; contribute significantly to unacceptable levels of siltation and salinity in major western watersheds including the Colorado River; negatively impact the quality and availability of scarce western water supplies; threaten important and frequently critical fish and wildlife habitat; prevent expansion of the forage resource and resulting benefits to livestock and wildlife production; increase surface runoff and flood danger; reduce the value of such lands for recreational and esthetic purposes; and may ultimately lead to unpredictable and undesirable long-term local and regional climatic and economic changes; (4) the above-mentioned conditions can be addressed and corrected by an intensive public rangelands maintenance, management, and improvement program involving significant increases in levels of rangeland management and improvement funding for multiple-use values; (5) to prevent economic disruption and harm to the western livestock industry, it is in the public interest to charge a fee for livestock grazing permits and leases on the public lands which is based on a formula reflecting annual changes in the costs of production; and (6) the Act of December 15, 1971 (85 Stat. 649,16 U.S.C. 1331 et seq.), continues to be successful in its goal of protecting wild free-roaming horses and burros from capture, branding, harassment, and death, but that certain amendments are necessary thereto to avoid excessive costs in the administration of the Act, and to facilitate the humane adoption or disposal of excess wild free-roaming horses and burros which because they exceed the carrying capacity of the range, pose a threat to their own habitat, fish, wildlife, recreation, water and soil conservation, domestic livestock grazing, and other rangeland values. The Congress therefore hereby establishes and reaffirms a national policy and commitment to: (1) inventory and identify current public rangelands conditions and trends as a part of the inventory process required by section 1711(a) of this title; (2) manage, maintain and improve the condition of the public rangelands so that they become as productive as feasible for all rangeland values in accordance with management objectives and the land use planning process established pursuant to section 1712 of this title; (3) charge a fee for public grazing use which is equitable and reflects the concerns addressed in paragraph (a)(5)above; and (4) continue the policy of protecting wild free-roaming horses and burros from capture, branding, harassment, or death, while at the same time facilitating the removal and disposal of excess wild free-roaming horses and burros which pose a threat to themselves and their habitat and to other rangeland values. The policies of this chapter shall become effective only as specific statutory authority for their implementation is enacted by this chapter or by subsequent legislation, and shall be construed as supplemental to and not in derogation of the purposes for which public rangelands are administered under other provisions of law.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/public-rangelands-improvement-43-usc-ch-37-lex-faoc199048/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3851,"Livestock, Land & soil, Water, Wild species & ecosystems", Legislation,"Range,Public land,Soil conservation/soil improvement,Soil pollution/quality,Soil rehabilitation,Desertification,Saltwater intrusion/siltation,Climate change,Lease,Classification/declassification,Survey/mapping,Royalties/fees,Animal feed/feedstuffs,Grazing,Animal production,Authorization/permit,Basin/catchment/watershed,Surface water,Water supply,Freshwater resources management,Flood,Rainwater,Protection of habitats,Ecosystem preservation,Equine-animals,Hunting authorization/permit","Americas, Arctic, East Pacific, North America, North Atlantic",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Trans-Alaska Pipeline Authorization Act (43 USC Ch. 34),,United States of America,"This act provides for the Trans-Alaska Pipeline authorization. It states the Congress finds and declares that: (a) the early development and delivery of oil and gas from Alaska's North Slope to domestic markets is in the national interest because of growing domestic shortages and increasing dependence upon insecure foreign sources; (b) the Department of the Interior and other Federal agencies, have, over a long period of time, conducted extensive studies of the technical aspects and of the environmental, social, and economic impacts of the proposed trans-Alaska oil pipeline, including consideration of a trans-Canada pipeline; (c) the earliest possible construction of a trans-Alaska oil pipeline from the North Slope of Alaska to Port Valdez in that State will make the extensive proven and potential reserves of low-sulfur oil available for domestic use and will best serve the national interest; and (d) a supplemental pipeline to connect the North Slope with a trans-Canada pipeline may be needed later and it should be studied now, but it should not be regarded as an alternative for a trans-Alaska pipeline that does not traverse a foreign country. The purpose of this chapter is to insure that, because of the extensive governmental studies already made of this project and the national interest in early delivery of North Slope oil to domestic markets, the trans-Alaska oil pipeline be constructed promptly without further administrative or judicial delay or impediment. To accomplish this purpose it is the intent of the Congress to exercise its constitutional powers to the fullest extent in the authorizations and directions herein made and in limiting judicial review of the actions taken pursuant thereto. The Congress hereby authorizes and directs the Secretary of the Interior and other appropriate Federal officers and agencies to issue and take all necessary action to administer and enforce rights-of-way, permits, leases, and other authorizations that are necessary for or related to the construction, operation, and maintenance of the trans-Alaska oil pipeline system, including roads and airstrips, as that system is generally described in the Final Environmental Impact Statement issued by the Department of the Interior on March 20, 1972. The route of the pipeline may be modified by the Secretary to provide during construction greater environmental protection.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/trans-alaska-pipeline-authorization-act-43-usc-ch-34-lex-faoc199045/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3852,"Energy, Land & soil", Legislation,"Oil,Natural gas,Transport/storage,Internal trade,Servitude,Use restrictions,Lease,Public land,Authorization/permit","Americas, Arctic, East Pacific, North America, North Atlantic",,ECOLEX_Legislation
Abandoned Shipwrecks (43 USC Ch. 39),,United States of America,"This chapter provides for abandoned shipwrecks. It states that the Congress finds that (a) States have the responsibility for management of a broad range of living and nonliving resources in State waters and submerged lands; and (b) included in the range of resources are certain abandoned shipwrecks, which have been deserted and to which the owner has relinquished ownership rights with no retention. In order to (1) clarify that State waters and shipwrecks offer recreational and educational opportunities to sport divers and other interested groups, as well as irreplaceable State resources for tourism, biological sanctuaries, and historical research; and (2) provide that reasonable access by the public to such abandoned shipwrecks be permitted by the State holding title to such shipwrecks pursuant to section 2105 of this title, it is the declared policy of the Congress that States carry out their responsibilities under this chapter to develop appropriate and consistent policies so as to (A) protect natural resources and habitat areas; (B) guarantee recreational exploration of shipwreck sites; and (C) allow for appropriate public and private sector recovery of shipwrecks consistent with the protection of historical values and environmental integrity of the shipwrecks and the sites. In managing the resources subject to the provisions of this chapter, States are encouraged to create underwater parks or areas to provide additional protection for such resources. Funds available to States from grants from the Historic Preservation Fund shall be available, in accordance with the provisions of chapter 3029 of title 54, for the study, interpretation, protection, and preservation of historic shipwrecks and properties. In order to encourage the development of underwater parks and the administrative cooperation necessary for the comprehensive management of underwater resources related to historic shipwrecks, the Secretary of the Interior, acting through the Director of the National Park Service, shall within nine months after April 28, 1988, prepare and publish guidelines in the Federal Register which shall seek to: (1) maximize the enhancement of cultural resources; (2) foster a partnership among sport divers, fishermen, archeologists, salvors, and other interests to manage shipwreck resources of the States and the United States; (3) facilitate access and utilization by recreational interests; (4) recognize the interests of individuals and groups engaged in shipwreck discovery and salvage. The United States asserts title to any abandoned shipwreck that is (1) embedded in submerged lands of a State; (2) embedded in coralline formations protected by a State on submerged lands of a State; or (3) on submerged lands of a State and is included in or determined eligible for inclusion in the National Register.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/abandoned-shipwrecks-43-usc-ch-39-lex-faoc199050/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3852,"Environment gen., Sea", Legislation,"Marine pollution,Pollution control,Tourism,Navigation,Transport/storage","Americas, Arctic, East Pacific, North America, North Atlantic",,ECOLEX_Legislation

United States Geological Survey (43 USC Ch. 2),,United States of America,"This chapter provides for the United States geological survey. It states that the Director of the United States Geological Survey, which office is established, under the Interior Department, shall be appointed by the President by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. This officer shall have the direction of the United States Geological Survey, and the classification of the public lands and examination of the geological structure, mineral resources, and products of the national domain. The Director and members of the United States Geological Survey shall have no personal or private interests in the lands or mineral wealth of the region under survey, and shall execute no surveys or examinations for private parties or corporations. The authority of the Secretary of the Interior, exercised through the United States Geological Survey of the Department of the Interior, to examine the geological structure, mineral resources, and products of the national domain, is expanded to authorize such examinations outside the national domain where determined by the Secretary to be in the national interest. The Congress finds and declares that (1) although significant progress has been made in the production of geologic maps since the establishment of the national cooperative geologic mapping program in 1992, no modern, digital, geologic map exists for approximately 75 percent of the United States; (2) geologic maps are the primary data base for virtually all applied and basic earth-science investigations, including (A) exploration for and development of mineral, energy, and water resources; (B) screening and characterizing sites for toxic and nuclear waste disposal; (C) land use evaluation and planning for homeland and environmental protection; (D) earthquake hazards reduction; (E) identifying volcanic hazards; (F) design and construction of infrastructure requirements such as utility lifelines, transportation corridors, and surface-water impoundments; (G) reducing losses from landslides and other ground failures; (H) mitigating effects of coastal and stream erosion; (I) siting of critical facilities; (J) recreation and public awareness; and (K) basic earth-science research; (3) Federal agencies, State and local governments, private industry, and the general public depend on the information provided by geologic maps to determine the extent of potential environmental damage before embarking on projects that could lead to preventable, costly environmental problems or litigation; (4) the combined capabilities of State, Federal, and academic groups to provide geologic mapping are not sufficient to meet the present and future needs of the United States for national security, environmental protection, and energy self-sufficiency of the Nation; (5) States are willing to contribute 50 percent of the funding necessary to complete the mapping of the geology within the State; (6) the lack of proper geologic maps has led to the poor design of such structures as dams and waste-disposal facilities; (7) geologic maps have proven indispensable in the search for needed fossil-fuel and mineral resources; (8) geologic map information is required for the sustainable and balanced development of natural resources of all types, including energy, minerals, land, water, and biological resources; (9) advances in digital technology and geographical information system science have made geologic map databases increasingly available as decision support tools for land and resource management; and (10) a comprehensive nationwide program of geologic mapping of surficial and bedrock deposits is required in order to systematically build the Nation's geologic-map data base at a pace that responds to increasing demand. The purpose of sections 31a to 31h of this title is to expedite the production of a geologic-map data base for the Nation, to be located within the United States Geological Survey, which can be applied to land-use management, assessment, and utilization, conservation of natural resources, groundwater management, and environmental protection and management.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/united-states-geological-survey-43-usc-ch-2-lex-faoc199008/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3852,"Energy, Land & soil, Mineral resources, Water, Wild species & ecosystems, Waste & hazardous substances", Legislation,"Energy conservation/energy production,Sustainable development,Survey/mapping,Institution,Governance,Classification/declassification,Public land,Research,Land-use planning,Protection of environment,Disasters,Risk assessment/management,Erosion,Access-to-information,Education,Minerals,Exploration,Waste disposal,Hazardous waste,Waste management,Water abstraction,Surface water,Hydropower generation,Waterworks,Groundwater","Americas, Arctic, East Pacific, North America, North Atlantic",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Agricultural Promotion (7 USC Ch. 101),,United States of America,"This chapter provides for agricultural promotion. It states that Congress finds the following: (1) it is in the national public interest and vital to the welfare of the agricultural economy of the United States to maintain and expand existing markets and develop new markets and uses for agricultural commodities through industry-funded, Government-supervised, generic commodity promotion programs established under commodity promotion laws; (2) these generic commodity promotion programs, funded by the agricultural producers or processors who most directly reap the benefits of the programs and supervised by the Secretary of Agriculture, provide a unique opportunity for producers and processors to inform consumers about their products; (3) the central congressional purpose underlying each commodity promotion law has always been to maintain and expand markets for the agricultural commodity covered by the law, rather than to maintain or expand the share of those markets held by any individual producer or processor; (4) the commodity promotion laws were neither designed nor intended to prohibit or restrict, and the promotion programs established and funded pursuant to these laws do not prohibit or restrict, individual advertising or promotion of the covered commodities by any producer, processor, or group of producers or processors; (5) it has never been the intent of Congress for the generic commodity promotion programs established and funded by the commodity promotion laws to replace the individual advertising and promotion efforts of producers or processors; (6) an individual producer's or processor's own advertising initiatives are typically designed to increase the share of the market held by that producer or processor rather than to increase or expand the overall size of the market; (7) in contrast, a generic commodity promotion program is intended and designed to maintain or increase the overall demand for the agricultural commodity covered by the program and increase the size of the market for that commodity, often by utilizing promotion methods and techniques that individual producers and processors typically are unable, or have no incentive, to employ; (8) the commodity promotion laws establish promotion programs that operate as ""self-help"" mechanisms for producers and processors to fund generic promotions for covered commodities which, under the required supervision and oversight of the Secretary of Agriculture (A) further specific national governmental goals, as established by Congress; and (B) produce nonideological and commercial communication the purpose of which is to further the governmental policy and objective of maintaining and expanding the markets for the covered commodities; (9) while some commodity promotion laws grant a producer or processor the option of crediting individual advertising conducted by the producer or processor for all or a portion of the producer's or processor's marketing promotion assessments, all promotion programs established under the commodity promotion laws, both those programs that permit credit for individual advertising and those programs that do not contain such provisions, are very narrowly tailored to fulfill the congressional purposes of the commodity promotion laws without impairing or infringing the legal or constitutional rights of any individual producer or processor; (10) these generic commodity promotion programs are of particular benefit to small producers who often lack the resources or market power to advertise on their own and who are otherwise often unable to benefit from the economies of scale available in promotion and advertising; and (11) periodic independent evaluation of the effectiveness of these generic commodity promotion programs will assist Congress and the Secretary of Agriculture in ensuring that the objectives of the programs are met.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/agricultural-promotion-7-usc-ch-101-lex-faoc198991/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3853,Agricultural & rural development, Legislation,"Agricultural development,Subsidy/incentive,Financial agricultural measures,Internal trade,Agricultural commodities,Business/industry/corporations,Farming","Americas, Arctic, East Pacific, North America, North Atlantic",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Wheat and Wheat Foods Research and Nutrition Education Act (7 USC Ch. 65),,United States of America,"This act concerns wheat and wheat foods research and nutrition education. It states that wheat is basic to the American diet and the American economy. It is grown by thousands of farmers and consumed, in various forms, by millions of people in the United States. The size of the American wheat crop and how it is marketed and ultimately consumed determines whether many Americans receive adequate nourishment. Wheat has a strong impact on the Nation's well-being. Additional research on the optimal use of wheat products can improve the American diet. Consumer education about the nutritional value and economic use of wheat products can enhance the national welfare. It has long been recognized that it is in the national interest to have a regular, adequate, and high quality wheat supply. It would be extremely difficult, without an effective coordinated research and nutrition education effort, to accomplish this objective. A programed effort of research and nutrition education is of great importance to wheat producers, processors, end product manufacturers, and consumers. It is the purpose of this chapter and in the public interest to authorize and enable the creation of an orderly procedure, adequately financed through an assessment, for the development and initiation of an effective and continuous coordinated program of research and nutrition education, designed to improve and enhance the quality, and make the most efficient use, of American wheat, processed wheat, and wheat end products to ensure an adequate diet for the people of the United States. The maximum rate of assessment authorized hereunder represents an infinitesimal proportion of the overall cost of manufacturing wheat end products. Therefore, such assessment will not significantly affect the retail prices of those products. Furthermore, any price effect will be more than offset by the increased efficiency in end product manufacture and increased consumer acceptance, due to nutritional improvements in wheat products, which may be expected to follow from adoption of a plan under this chapter. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to provide for control of production or otherwise limit the right of individual wheat producers to produce wheat.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/wheat-and-wheat-foods-research-and-nutrition-education-act-7-usc-ch-65-lex-faoc198961/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3853,"Agricultural & rural development, Food & nutrition", Legislation,"Crops/grasses,Cereals/grains/rice,Research,Internal trade,Business/industry/corporations,Cooperative/producer organization,Policy/planning,Nutrition,Education","Americas, Arctic, East Pacific, North America, North Atlantic",,ECOLEX_Legislation
