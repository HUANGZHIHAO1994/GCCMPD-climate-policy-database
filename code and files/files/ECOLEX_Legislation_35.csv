Ordonnance nº 93-015 fixant les principes d'orientation du Code rural.,1993.0,Niger,"La présente ordonnance fixe les principes qui gouvernent l'utilisation des terres, de l'eau et des forêts dans les zones rurales. Par mesure de principe, l'ordonnance prévoit que les droits qui s'exercent sur les ressources naturelles bénéficient d'une égale protection, qu'ils résultent de la coutume ou du droit écrit. Notamment, la propriété pleine et effective de la terre résulte de la propriété coutumière, qui est elle-même conférée par la succession depuis des temps immémoriaux et confirmée par la mémoire collective, ou l'attribution par une autorité coutumière, ou tout autre mode d'acquisition reconnu. Les propriétaires ne peuvent être privés de leur droit que dans le respect des procédures prévues par la loi portant sur l'expropriation pour cause d'utilité publique. Tout utilisateur de terres rurales, d'eau et de forêts est tenu par la loi à les gérer de façon rationnelle. Notamment, les propriétaires autant que les locataires doivent tout mettre en oeuvre pour assurer la mise en valeur du sol; le respect de ces obligations fait l'objet de vérifications périodiques; en cas de non-respect, l'usage du sol est confié temporairement à un tiers désigné par le gouvernement ou entraîne la perte de jouissance du fonds. Tous les pasteurs ont l'usage commun des espaces globalement réservés au parcours, aux pâturages et au pacage. Cependant, les pasteurs peuvent se voir reconnaître un droit d'usage prioritaire sur les sols qu'ils utilisent, mais ceci n'exclut pas les droits d'accès des tiers aux points d'eau, de parcours et de pacage. Les pasteurs ne peuvent être privés de leur droit d'usage prioritaire que pour cause d'utilité publique et après indemnisation. Le capital-bétail constitue un bien de propriété individuelle ou collective, dont la garde ou la gestion peut être exercée par le propriétaire ou par un tiers, qui peut être solidairement responsable avec le gardien en cas de dommage causé par le bétail à l'environnement ou à un tiers. Les aménagements hydro-agricoles effectués à des fins agricoles sont placés sous le régime de la propriété privée. Tout individu peut aménager un point d'eau d'usage pastoral avec l'accord préalable des communautés titulaires de l'usage prioritaire sur l'espace concerné. Les points d'eau sont la propriété des individus ou des communautés, et leur propriétaire est tenu de les entretenir, et de protéger la ressource hydraulique. Les forêts, qui sont définies en fonction de leurs produits peuvent être des forêts domaniales qui doivent être classées et dont le régime juridique doit être fixé, ou des forêts privées. Cependant, les propriétaires de forêts privées ne peuvent y exercer leurs droits que si leurs pratiques ne présentent aucune menace pour l'environnement ni un danger pour le public. Dans les forêts domaniales, l'exercice des droits coutumiers d'usage est limité au ramassage de certains produits forestiers, et sont sans effet dans les zones de restauration. Cependant, les limites des forêts domaniales sont toujours fixées de manière qu'en dehors d'elles subsistent des surfaces boisées suffisantes pour l'exercice des droits coutumiers des riverains. Si cela n'est pas possible, l'exercice des droits coutumiers d'usage fera l'objet d'un règlement d'aménagement de ces usages. De plus, le droit coutumier de parcours des pasteurs peut être interdit, sans compensation. L'exploitation des forêts domaniales peut être faite en régie, par vente de coupes, par permis temporaire d'exploitation ou par permis de coupe d'un nombre limité d'arbres, l'exploitant étant dans l'obligation de replanter les espèces décimées. Toute forme de culture est interdite à l'intérieur des forêts domaniales et des périmètres de restauration, y compris les cultures sur brûlis dans les forêts privées. Les interdictions relatives à la protection et la regénération des forêts sont énoncées. Dans le but de favoriser le reboisement, le gouvernement peut accorder en dotation révocable aux particuliers ou aux collectivités des zones domaniales nues ou couvertes de boisements dégradés, à charge pour eux de les reboiser. L'ordonnance établit également les principes généraux concernant la propriété de bétail et la santé animale, elle prévoit des dispositions détaillées concernant la pêche, et le cadre juridique relatif à la protection de la faune sauvage, fondé sur un système de réserves naturelles. Des dispositions détaillées prévoient l'administration de l'ordonnance. Entre autres, il est prévu que les autorités coutumières collaborent avec les autorités administratives en matière de police rurale et de règlement de conflits. L'ordonnance porte création de deux nouvelles institutions, à savoir le comité national du Code rural et d'une Commission foncière dans chaque arrondissement. L'ordonnance porte création de deux nouveaux instruments conçus pour la mise en valeur des zones rurales, à savoir le schéma d'aménagement foncier et le dossier rural. Un schéma d'aménagement foncier est institué dans chaque département. Il précise les espaces affectés aux diverses activités rurales ainsi que les droits qui s'y exercent. Les populations rurales interviennent dans l'élaboration du schéma, qui est adopté par le Conseil des ministres. Les autorisations d'utilisation de l'espace et des richesses agricoles, forestières et pastorales doivent être conformes aux prescriptions du schéma d'aménagement foncier. Les dossiers ruraux tiennent lieu de registre des droits fonciers mais l'attestation d'inscription ne constitue pas un titre de propriété. Elle est opposable au tiers. Pour finir, des dispositions générales prévoient la formation de groupements d'opérateurs ruraux, instituent un système de crédit agricole, et réglementent le contentieux rural. A cet égard, une tentative de conciliation des conflits par les autorités coutumières doit obligatoirement précéder la procédure judiciaire.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/ordonnance-no-93-015-fixant-les-principes-dorientation-du-code-rural-lex-faoc004660/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3477,"Agricultural & rural development, Land & soil, Water", Legislation,"Basic legislation,Agricultural development,Policy/planning,Agricultural land,Pastoralism,Land tenure,Range,Ownership,Traditional rights/customary rights,Right of use,Irrigation,Sustainable development","Africa, Sahel, Western Africa",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Loi nº 93-06 portant le code forestier.,1993.0,Senegal,"La présente loi se substitue à la partie législative du Code forestier du 18 juillet 1974 qui, vingt ans après son adoption, avait besoin d'être adapté aux transformations de la société en général et des forêts en particulier. A certains égards, la nouvelle loi innove par rapport à la précédente, notamment en encourageant la foresterie communautaire et l'initiative privée. C'est ainsi qu'elle prévoit la possibilité de concéder gratuitement une forêt de l'Etat à une collectivité locale, qui la gère alors à son seul profit, suivant un plan d'aménagement établi par le service forestier. Elle accorde en outre aux collectivités locales une ristourne d'une partie des ressources du Fonds forestier national, issue des redevances et des adjudications de coupes. La loi reconnaît par ailleurs la propriété privée des plantations forestières réalisées par les particuliers, mais sans leur concéder la propriété du sol ainsi planté. De plus, elle leur fait obligation de gérer rationnellement ces plantations et de procéder à leur reboisement. Mis à part ces apports originaux, la nouvelle loi reste assez proche de celle qu'elle abroge, notamment en ce que la majeure partie de ses dispositions est d'ordre répressif. Elle est formée par 80 articles répartis en 4 titres, à savoir: De la mise en valeur des forêts (I); Répression des infractions (II); Agents des eaux, forêts et chasse (III); Dispositions finales (IV).¦ Le premier titre comporte deux chapitres consacrés d'une part aux droits d'exploitation, de l'autre aux droits d'usage. Le second titre détermine, lui aussi en deux chapitres, la procédure à suivre (en matière de recherche et de constatation, d'actions et de poursuites, de transactions, de saisies et de confiscations) et les sanctions applicables aux différentes infractions. Enfin, le troisième titre traite, en trois chapitres, du rôle, de la protection, des obligations et des pouvoirs des agents des eaux et forêts dans le domaine de la police forestière.

Ley Nº 14/1992 - Patrimonio agrario de la Comunidad Autónoma y medidas de reforma y desarrollo agrario.,1992.0,Spain,"La presente Ley persigue los siguientes objetivos, en primer lugar, la regulación del patrimonio agrario de la Comunidad Autónoma de Aragón para evitar que las tierras una vez transformadas y adjudicadas puedan acumularse en unos pocos propietarios; en segundo lugar, trata de subsanar las deficiencias de la Ley de Reforma y Desarrollo Agrario, en especial con referencia al régimen establecido para las tierras reservadas en las zonas regables, la conversión de las mismas en tierras en exceso mediante la transmisión por actos inter vivos y el establecimiento de un mecanismo legal que evite fenómenos especulativos o de acumulación de propiedad de tierras reservadas permitiendo no obstante, la transmisión de las mismas. Para finalizar en materia de concentración parcelaria privada, la Ley pretende una regulación más operativa y precisa que la establecida en la Ley de Reforma y Desarrollo Agrario. Se consideran patrimonio agrario de la Comunidad Autónoma de Aragón: el conjunto de derechos reales que la Comunidad Autónoma ostente sobre los siguientes bienes inmuebles susceptibles de explotación agraria: los adquiridos en ejecución de procedimientos de transformación de grandes zonas y comarcas, los adquiridos en virtud del ejercicio de derechos preferentes, los cedidos en uso a la Diputación General de Aragón y los adquiridos en virtud de cualquier otro título (art. 1º). Corresponde la gestión de los bienes y derechos del patrimonio agrario de la Comunidad al Departamento de Agricultura, Ganadería y Montes. Además se constituye como órgano consultivo y de participación: el Consejo del Patrimonio Agrario, integrado por representantes de los ayuntamientos, organizaciones agrarias y administración autonómica (art. 2º). Entre las competencias del Consejo se señala la emisión de un informe previo sobre la convocatoria de los concursos para la adjudicación de los bienes del patrimonio agrario y el ejercicio de las acciones de rescate y recuperación de bienes adjudicados (art. 9º). Los inmuebles que forman parte del patrimonio agrario de la Comunidad Autónoma sobre los que ésta ostente el pleno dominio podrán ser adjudicados en propiedad o en concesión, a elección del adjudicatario (art. 10). Los inmuebles que se adjudiquen en propiedad quedarán sometidos, en todo caso, al régimen de ""acceso diferido a la propiedad"", durante la vigencia de este régimen el adjudicatario gozará de la posesión y el usufructo de los bienes adjudicados, mientras que el nudo dominio pertenecerá a la Diputación General de Aragón (art. 11). Con respecto a los bienes del patrimonio agrario sobre los que la Comunidad Autónoma carezca de pleno dominio serán adjudicados en régimen de concesión (art. 15). Ninguna concesión podrá tener una duración superior a la del derecho real limitado y en todo caso, se extinguirá con éste. La Ley establece normas para la adjudicación de bienes del patrimonio agrario de la Comunidad Autónoma aplicables tanto al régimen de propiedad como al de concesión; en este sentido, se establecen tanto requisitos personales como criterios objetivos para la adjudicación (arts. 20 y 21). Las concesiones para la constitución de explotaciones familiares agrarias se otorgarán en términos generales con carácter vitalicio, en cambio, las concesiones a entidades asociativas no podrán exceder de treinta años, con posibilidad de renovación (art. 24). El Departamento de Agricultura, Ganadería y Montes podrá acordar la explotación directa de determinados bienes del patrimonio agrario de la Comunidad (art. 29). La Comunidad goza de derechos de adquisición preferente con respecto a los bienes que en su origen hayan pertenecido en propiedad al patrimonio agrario de la Comunidad Autónoma de Aragón (art. 31). La Ley establece un régimen especial para la transmisión de tierras reservadas en zonas regables, considerándose éstas como aquellas que hayan sido adquiridas por actos inter vivos con posterioridad a la aprobación del plan general. Y así mismo, establece un procedimiento especial para la realización de concentraciones parcelarias de carácter privado (tít.

Ley Forestal (1992).,1992.0,Mexico,"La Ley consta de 4 títulos, 58 artículos y 9 transitorios. INDICE: Disposiciones generales (I): Objeto de la Ley (1), Autoridad en materia forestal (2), Coordinación y concertación en materia forestal (3); Administración y manejo de los recursos forestales (II): Inventario forestal nacional y zonificación forestal (1), Aprovechamiento de recursos forestales, forestación y reforestación (2), Transporte y almacenamiento de materias primas forestales (3), Servicios técnicos forestales (4), Creación, organización y administración de reservas y zonas forestales y parques nacionales (5), Prevención, combate y control de incendios forestales (6), Sanidad forestal (7), Vedas forestales (8); Fomento a la actividad forestal (III): Conservación, protección y restauración forestales (1), Infraestructura vial (2), Cultura, educación, capacitación e investigación forestales (3); Visitas de inspección, auditorías técnicas, infracciones y delitos (IV). La presente Ley es reglamentaria del artículo 27 de la Constitución Política de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos en materia forestal, es de observancia general en todo el territorio nacional, sus disposiciones son de orden público e interés social y tienen por objeto regular el aprovechamiento de los recursos forestales del país y fomentar su conservación, producción, protección y restauración (ar. 1º). La aplicación de esta Ley corresponde al ejecutivo federal por conducto de la Secretaría de Agricultura y Recursos Hidráulicos (ar. 4º). En general se puede afirmar que la política forestal en que se enmarcó la Ley Forestal del 14 abril 1986 tenía una afinidad con el paradigma de protección del ambiente y que se reflejaba en una excesiva centralización en manos del Gobierno Federal de todas las funciones de la autoridad forestal, tanto normativas como operativas, produciendo una limitación en la actuación de los particulares que debían acatar las múltiples regulaciones establecidas en relación con toda la cadena productiva y concentrar su ámbito de acción en el aprovechamiento de los recursos; asimismo, los estados y municipios guardaban un papel secundario y limitado en la cadena de autoridad en la materia, lo cual resultó contraproducente pues los recursos con que cuenta la Federación, tanto humanos como materiales, para cumplir con las enormes responsabilidades y funciones que la Ley le imponía y atribuía, resultaron insuficientes. Por el contrario, uno de los objetivos principales de la nueva política forestal es el establecer las condiciones para que los agentes económicos involucrados en la actividad se conviertan en los principales custodios de los recursos forestales. Al Estado, cuyo papel se redimensiona bajo el nuevo esquema, le corresponde establecer con el concurso directo de los interesados las reglas para asegurar que el aprovechamiento de los recursos forestales se lleve a cabo de manera tal que los bosques del país se puedan conservar y acrecentar con el tiempo.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/ley-forestal-1992-lex-faoc007996/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3489,Forestry, Legislation,"Basic legislation,Institution,Policy/planning,Timber extraction/logging,Afforestation/reforestation,Transport/storage,Forest service/forest officers,Protected area,Forest fires,Forestry protection measures,Research,Inspection,Offences/penalties,Erosion,Forest management/forest conservation","Americas, Central America, East Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean, LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN FAO, North Atlantic, North Pacific, North-East Pacific",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Ordonnance nº 92-1140 relative au Code forestier applicable dans la collectivité territoriale de Mayotte.,1992.0,Mayotte (France),"La présente ordonnance adapte le Code forestier métropolitain à la collectivité territoriale de Mayotte. En la forme, l'ordonnance est structurée de manière quasiment identique à ce Code. Après des dispositions préliminaires, elle comprend cinq livres traitant successivement: du régime forestier; des biens forestiers et agro-forestières des particuliers; de la conservation et de la police des biens forestiers et agro-forestiers en général; des forêts de protection et de la lutte contre l'érosion; de l'inventaire et de la mise en valeur des ressources ligneuses et agro-forestières. Sur le fond, l'ordonnance apporte quelques innovations par rapport au Code forestier métropolitain, dont les principales concernent les points suivants: (1) les biens régis par l'ordonnance sont dits forestiers ou agro-forestiers (alors que le Code parle en général de forêts, bois ou terrains à boiser. Les biens forestiers sont ceux qui portent des essences forestières (tels que forêts, bois, mangroves, terrains à destination forestière et leurs dépendances). Les biens agro-forestiers sont ceux qui, sans être forestiers, portent des essences forestières nécessaires à la conservation des sols et des eaux, concurremment avec des utilisations agricoles; (2) la commission territoriale des forêts est chargée d'élaborer des orientations politiques pour la mise en valeur économique, écologique et sociale des biens forestiers et agro-forestiers, publics et privés, de la collectivité territoriale; (3) les conseils municipaux ou les représentants des communautés usagères doivent être préalablement consultés lors-qu'un projet (tel que boisement ou exploitation de carrières) est susceptible d'affecter durablement l'exercice des droits d'usage sur des biens forestiers ou agro-fores- tiers domaniaux; (4) les droits d'usage ne peuvent être exercés dans les forêts de l'Etat que par ceux dont les droits ont été reconnus fondés par une décision judiciaire ou administrative dans l'année qui suit la promulgation de la présente ordonnance; (5) les propriétaires de biens forestiers et agro-forestiers et les propriétaires riverains de ces mêmes biens ne peuvent se livrer à aucun acte d'exploitation ou de défrichement sans que leurs propriétés aient été préalablement délimitées et bornées; (6) une servitude de passage et d'aménagement, dont l'assiette ne peut excéder quatre mètres, est établie par les autorités compétentes dans le but exclusif d'assurer la continuité des voies de défense contre les incendies de biens forestiers ou agro-forestiers; (7) peuvent être déclarés d'utilité publique, et exécutés dans des périmètres fixés par arrêté, les travaux nécessaires au maintien des terres en pente, à la défense des sols contre l'érosion, à la régularisation du régime des eaux et à l'équilibre écologique de Mayotte.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/ordonnance-no-92-1140-relative-au-code-forestier-applicable-dans-la-collectivite-territoriale-de-mayotte-lex-faoc004695/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3496,Forestry, Legislation,"Forest management/forest conservation,Framework law,Agro-forestry,Private forest,Protection forest,Erosion,Inventory,Traditional rights/customary rights,Right of use","Africa, Eastern Africa, European Union Countries, Indian Ocean",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Pacific Yew Act (Public Law 102-335),1992.0,United States of America,"This Act is based upon Congressional findings that appropriate management guidelines should be implemented promptly to prevent the wasting of Pacific yew tree species, from which taxol is derived to treat certain types of cancer, while successful and affordable alternative methods of manufacturing taxol are being developed. The Act's requirements expire upon notice to Congress from the Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior, based upon a determination by the Secretary of Health and Human Services, that quantities of taxol sufficient to satisfy medicinal demands are available from sources other than Pacific yew trees harvested on Federal lands. The purpose of the Act is to manage Pacific yew trees located on National Forest lands and on public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management so that Pacific yew can be collected and utilized efficiently, taxol can be produced commercially and sold at a reasonable cost to cancer patients, and the Pacific yew can be conserved over the long-term. The Secretaries of Agriculture and Interior are required to pursue a conservation and management policy on lands under their respective jurisdictions. The content of this policy stated broadly in the Act includes priorities in planning Pacific yew harvests and specified means of harvesting to minimize any adverse effects on the survival and regeneration of Pacific yew trees. Immediate consultation is specifically required under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 if a Secretary foresees the need to harvest Pacific yew in an area where an opinion under that Act has already concluded that commercial timber sales are likely to jeopardize the continued existence of an endangered or threatened species or destroy or adversely modify critical habitat identified for the species.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/pacific-yew-act-public-law-102-335-lex-faoc005587/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3502,Forestry, Legislation,"Forest management/forest conservation,Public forest,Protection of species","Americas, Arctic, East Pacific, North America, North Atlantic",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Part II of the Decree establishes the post of Conservator of Forests, and a Forestry Board to be chaired by the Conservator. Part III gives the Minister, upon recommendation of the Forestry Board, the right to create forest or nature reserves from the following classes of land: (a) unalienated State land; (b) land leased to the State; and (c) unalienated native land, with the prior consent of the owners of the land and of the Native Land Trust Board. Similarly, the Minister may de-reserve such reserves, and may cause alienated land to be acquired under the Crown Acquisition of Lands Act for the purposes of making such reserves. Forest Reserves are to be managed ""as permanent forest in order to provide on a permanent basis the optimum combination of benefits of protection and production of which they are capable"".

A licensing officer may grant a licence authorizing many of the otherwise prohibited activities, although in the case of native lands or State lands outside of reserves the prior consent of the Native Land Trust Board and the Director of Lands, respectively, is required. The Conservator has broad powers to suspend a licence if a violation has or is likely to occur, and a licensee is responsible for any damage caused by a lack of compliance. Part V states that nothing in the Decree shall be deemed to prohibit or restrict the exercise on native land (outside of reserves) of native customary rights to hunt fish or collective wild fruits and vegetables, or the cutting of forest produce in accordance with native custom for construction of temporary huts, fishing stakes, and certain other constructions. The Minister may, however, prohibit the felling or removal of timber of a specified class, dimension or description by order in the Gazette, even if otherwise allowed by native custom. Furthermore, this Part shall not be deemed to authorize the setting of grass or undergrowth fires. Part VI deals with the disposal of abandoned or seized property.

"Law on Land Reform, 1992.",1992.0,Tajikistan,"The centrepiece of the Law on Land Reform is the creation of Special Land Funds administered by local authorities, for the assignment of user rights thereon, including, in particular, lease rights, to individuals and concerns. Private ownership of land is contemplated only as a result of the disbanding of collective enterprises (art. 14), but it is the stated policy of the Republic of Tajikistan not to restore ownership of land formerly held by ""ancestors"" and religious institutions (art. 2.2). The land reform process is to be carried out in two phases, where actual assignment of user rights will follow a thorough inventory of the status quo (art. 4). For purposes of creating the Special Land Funds, land can be expropriated from the relevant owners or users, and relevant decisions are appealable in the courts (art. 11). A priority order in the assignment of land user rights is established, with citizens intending to engage in private farming having first call (art. 12). User rights have life-long duration, and can be transferred by succession (art. 3). A system of state certificates will provide the necessary evidence of the ownership or user rights described therein (arts. 19 and 20).",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/law-on-land-reform-1992-lex-faoc004684/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3518,Land & soil, Legislation,"Land reform,Lease,Land tenure,Special fund,Right of use","Asia, Central Asia, CIS (Commonwealth of Independent States), EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA, Landlocked Developing Countries, North Asia",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Full tourism development zones are those that offer excellent geographic conditions and natural beauty, making them particularly appropriate for tourism, and are declared as such by Decree.

The management of full tourism development zones is the responsibility of the Government, which administers them through the National Tourism Institute, without prejudice to the powers of the municipal authorities regarding the provision of urban services. The tourism reserve and protection zones, set up by Decree, are areas adjacent to full tourism development zones, with great natural beauty and value, which must be preserved in order to ensure that Cape Verde tourism is competitive in the short and medium term. This also applies to other areas of great natural beauty, which must be maintained as reserves to be subsequently declared full tourism development zones.

La partie II du livre III porte régime des forêts; ses dispositions réglementent l'aménagement des forêts (titre II), l'exploitation et la protection forestières, les droits d'usage, la gestion des produits forestiers, les mesures de protection, les feux de brousse, la divagation des animaux (titre III). Le Livre III, première partie (articles 209 jusqu'à 270), du présent Kiti établit le régime de l'eau. Il définit les principes et le champ d'application (Titre I), crée le cadre juridique pour l'utilisation de l'eau (Titre II) et la protection des ressources en eau (Titre III). La troisième partie du livre III de ce Kiti porte régime de la faune. Elle comprend 2 titres, à savoir: Aménagement des aires fauniques (I) qui porte définitions des différentes aires fauniques et fixe les conditions requises pour leur aménagement, et en particulier, prévoit la possibilité de classer une zone forestière publique comme réserve de la biosphère; Exploitation et protection de la faune (II) qui porte définition et régime de la chasse et de la capture d'animaux ainsi que les mesures de protection de la faune. Les dispositions concernant la pêche (articles de 383 à 417), intitulées ""du régime des pêches"", constituent la quatrième partie du Livre III du présent Kiti et sont organisées en 4 chapitres, à savoir: Des aménagements piscicoles (I);De l'exploitation (II); De la protection du stock halieutique et du milieu aquatique (III); Des sanctions (IV). Ce texte distingue trois catégories de pêches: les pêches de subsistance ou pêches villageoises, les pêches artisanales et les pêches sportives (article 387). Il introduit une distinction entre les aménagements piscicoles de type moderne et ceux de type artisanal fondée sur le degré de perfectionnement des équipements (articles de 392 à 395). Le principe d'appartenance du droit de pêche à l'Etat est affirmé. Cependant, les personnes physiques ou morales, publiques ou privées peuvent jouir du droit de pêche sous forme d'un permis ou d'une concession (article 396). La concession de l'exercice du droit de pêche est réservée aux seules organisations de pêcheurs (article 402). Les articles 408 à 416 définissent le régime de protection de la ressource halieutique. Ainsi, le Ministre chargé des pêches a le pouvoir réglementaire d'interdire les activités de pêche sur les eaux domaniales ou stagnantes pendant certaines périodes (article 408). Tout déversement de substances toxiques ou polluantes pouvant affecter les poissons est subordonné à la double autorisation des Ministres chargés des pêches et de l'hydraulique (article 409). L'article 410 énumère les méthodes de pêche prohibées. Les engins de pêche interdits et leurs caractéristiques font l'objet des articles 414 et 415. Toutefois, la liste établie à l'article 414 ne s'applique ni aux plans d'eau concédés ni aux étangs de pisciculture. Finalement, l'article 417 prévoit les sanctions aux infractions des dispositions du présent kiti. La cinquième partie du kiti prévoit les dispositions communes aux régimes des forêts, de faune et des pêches, dont, notamment, celles relatives à la recherche et à la constatation des infractions et aux confiscations et saisies.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/kiti-no-an-viii-0328-terfpplan-coop-portant-application-de-la-reorganisation-agraire-et-fonciere-au-burkina-faso-lex-faoc001066/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3547,"Fisheries, Forestry, Water, Wild species & ecosystems", Regulation,"Basic legislation,Traditional rights/customary rights,Concession,Aquaculture,Artisanal fishing,Non-commercial fishing,Fishing authorization,Inland fisheries,Navigation,Research,Freshwater quality/freshwater pollution,Fishing gear/fishing method,Alien species,Offences/penalties,Enforcement/compliance,Authorization/permit,Inspection,Fishery management and conservation,Public forest,Protection forest,Policy/planning,Timber extraction/logging,Forest fires,Forest management/forest conservation,Priorities,Inland waters,Institution,Rainwater,Bed,Water abstraction,Servitude,Water supply,Water shortage/drought,Water rights,Protected area,Hunting/capture,Hunting authorization/permit,Wildlife products,Biodiversity","Africa, AFRICA FAO, Landlocked Developing Countries, Least Developed Countries, Sahel, Western Africa",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Ley Nº 10/1991 - Ley para la protección del medio ambiente.,1991.0,Spain,"La Ley consta de 4 títulos, 42 artículos, 9 disposiciones adicionales, 2 transitorias, 2 derogatorias, 2 finales y 4 anexos. INDICE: Disposiciones generales (I); Evaluación del impacto ambiental (II); Calificación ambiental (III): Concepto (1), Competencias (2), Procedimiento (3); Disciplina ambiental (IV): Disposiciones generales (1), Disciplina de calificación ambiental (2); Proyectos, obras y actividades que deberán someterse a Evaluación de impacto ambiental - Legislación del Estado (anexo 1); Proyectos, obras y actividades que deberán someterse a Evaluación de impacto ambiental - Comunidad de Madrid (anexo 2); Actividades que deberán someterse a Calificación ambiental por la Agencia de medio ambiente (anexo 3); Actividades que deberán someterse a Calificación ambiental - Competencia municipal (anexo 4). La presente Ley tiene por objeto establecer un sistema de normas adicionales de protección del medio ambiente en la Comunidad de Madrid, en el marco de la legislación básica del Estado (art. 1º), que básicamente elevan el nivel de protección marcado por la legislación vigente y, de forma complementaria, actualizan y adaptan los sistemas existentes adecuándolos a la estructura de la Administración Autonómica. La presente Ley se ha articulado siguiendo la doble línea de protección ambiental establecida por la legislación del Estado: la de Evaluación del impacto ambiental (EIA) regulada por el Real Decreto Legislativo Nº 1302/1986 y por el Real Decreto Nº 1131/1988 y la de Calificación ambiental, que constituyen respectivamente los títulos II y III de la misma. Respecto de la EIA, sin perjuicio de la remisión en bloque a la normativa estatal básica, se eleva el nivel de protección ahora existente mediante la ampliación de los supuestos en que diversos proyectos, obras o actividades han de someterse a Estudios y Declaración, al propio tiempo que se prevén los mecanismos de adaptación a la estructura organizativa de la Comunidad de Madrid. Respecto a la Calificación, y partiendo del sistema de protección basado en un informe ambiental previo a la licencia municipal de apertura, la Ley actualiza, profundiza, sistematiza y adapta las previsiones del precursor Reglamento de actividades molestas, insalubres, nocivas y peligrosas. El título IV regula la vigilancia y disciplina ambiental como garantía ineludible de la eficacia práctica de la norma, sancionando tanto su incumplimiento como cualquier agresión que pueda afectar a la calidad del medio ambiente; este segundo aspecto, de carácter innovador, constituye un mecanismo de cierre del sistema protector. La Ley trata con especial cuidado la asignación de competencias medioambientales a los municipios, asignación en que resultaba precisa una adecuada ponderación entre dos principios: el de máxima descentralización y potenciación de la autonomía local, y el de mantenimiento de un ámbito de actuación propio de la Comunidad de Madrid que le permita atender directamente a las exigencias medioambientales en aquellos supuestos de especial peligrosidad o de ausencia de actuación de otra administración. La consideración de ambos principios ha llevado a establecer el sistema competencial de la presente Ley, basado en la flexibilidad y en la utilización de diversas fórmulas de relación interadministrativa. El artículo 3º especifica que el órgano ambiental de la Comunidad de Madrid es la Agencia de Medio Ambiente, competencia que le ha sido atribuida por la Ley 3/1988, para la Gestión del medio ambiente. Mediante la disposición adicional 2ª se crea la Escala de Agentes Ambientales, integrada en el cuerpo de técnicos auxiliares de administración especial. Las funciones de los agentes son: a) la identificación de industrias o focos contaminantes y la tipificación de la contaminación; b) la colaboración en materia medioambiental; c) la participación en campañas de educación ambiental y sensibilización de la población; d) la elevación de denuncias e informes a la Agencia de Medio Ambiente sobre hechos que atenten contra el medio ambiente, tanto en el medio rural como en el urbano; e) la colaboración en los programas de la Agencia de Medio Ambiente en los que sea necesaria su intervención; f) cualquier otra que se le encomiende legalmente (disposición adicional 3ª).",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/ley-no-101991-ley-para-la-proteccion-del-medio-ambiente-lex-faoc005491/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3550,Environment gen., Legislation,"Protection of environment,Basic legislation,EIA,Institution,Ecosystem preservation,Offences/penalties,Environmental audit,Environmental standards,Protection of habitats","Europe, EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA, European Union Countries, Mediterranean, North Atlantic, North-East Atlantic, Southern Europe",,ECOLEX_Legislation

In cases of reconstruction and modernization of production processes in operation, the standard levels concerning new projects apply. The quantities of production and flue gases and the content of harmful substances in them should be recalculated for standard conditions (760 mm mercury column and °C) and dry gases. Everywhere in the text standard levels in mg/m3 and quantities of gases in m3 are given in standard conditions. Gas emissions from technological production processes are assessed in respect to their content and quantity immediately at the exit of the last technological installation, after which they are led to the treatment facility or are emitted into the atmosphere. If because of technological reasons or safety considerations dilution with fresh air is imperative or if penetration of fresh air into the track leading to the treatment facility is possible, the contaminant levels found after treatment are recalculated into quantities immediately at the exit of the flow line. For this purpose the oxygen content is measured at the exits of the flow line and of the treatment facility and the emission level is recalculated on the basis of these results, excluding the volume of additionally imported air. The testing of emissions by control authorities and by other organizations is carried out using methodologies, recommended by the Bulgarian State Standard, and when such a standard is unavailable – by methodologies approved by the Minister of Environment.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/decree-of-the-ministry-of-environment-regarding-standard-levels-of-permissible-emissions-concentration-in-waste-gases-of-harmful-substances-emitted-into-the-atmosphere-1991-lex-faoc038114/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3556,Air & atmosphere, Regulation,"Air quality/air pollution,Hazardous substances,Emissions,Environmental standards,Pollution control","Black Sea, Eastern Europe, Europe, EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA, European Union Countries",,ECOLEX_Legislation

Regulations for the implementation of the Land Administration Law of the People's Republic of China.,1991.0,China,"These Regulations issued in implementation of article 56 of the Land Management Law, provide for (a) registration of landownership and land-use rights; (b) the systematic surveying of lands, land-use planning, and other mechanisms to control land use; (c) procedures for the expropriation of land needed for public construction purposes; (d) restrictions on the use of agricultural land for housing purposes; and (e) criteria for the determination of the kind and amount of fines payable for offences committed under the principal Law. The Regulations have become effective on 1 February 1991 (art. 40). At the outset, the Regulations clarify what kinds of land are susceptible to State or people's ownership. This important definition groups all urban lands, rural and peri-urban lands which have been confiscated, requisitioned, purchased or nationalized; and forest lands, grasslands, mountains, wasteland, shoals, foodland, and other types of lands which are not the object of collective ownership (art. 3). Ownership of collectively owned land, and user rights in state-owned land are to be registered with the government at county level or above. Upon registration, ""collective land deeds"" are issued confirming ownership of collective land, or ""user certificates"" are issued confirming user right in state-owned lands (art. 4). Any change in ownership or user rights as a result, inter alia, of transfer are to be duly recorded, and the relevant titles amended accordingly (art. 6). All disputes involving land-ownership and use rights are handled by the Government at the appropriate level (art. 8). The Regulations direct the central and the local governments to prepare, respectively, national and local land survey plans, leading to the establishment of a systematic land survey of the country (art. 9). A land grading system is to form part of the survey exercise (art.10). The Government is also directed to build up a land statistical system (art.11). The Regulations also provide in embryo for land-use planning mechanisms. The central and the local governments are directed to prepare, respectively, a national and local (i.e. at county and township levels) land-use plans (art. 12). In addition, the development of barren hills, wasteland and shoals, and the proposed conversion of farmland into non-farmland uses, are subject to a local government permit (arts. 13, 14). Detailed procedural rules govern the taking of land for public construction, railway, highway, oil or water piping, and emergency and disaster relief operations. The guiding principle in this matter is that a proposed taking must be economically justified and ""reasonable"". Concrete determinations are made by the competent local government authorities on the basis of this broad criterion (arts. 17-20). Compensation is expressly contemplated as part of the process (art. 18(b)), but mandatory language is employed only with reference to two specific cases (arts. 22 and 23). The use of agricultural farmland for housing projects is strictly regulated both if the project proponent is a villager and if he/she is a town resident. In both cases, the project is to be screened at different levels of authority, but no criteria are given to guide decisions (arts. 24-26). Among the offences under the principal Act which come under the fine-scoping provisions of the Rules are serious damage to the farming environment and causing land desertification, salinization and soil erosion through land development activities. In this latter case, the determination of the amount of the fine is left to the discretion of the local Government concerned (art. 34), while in the former reference is made to the provisions of separate regulations. The State Land Administration Bureau is designated to administer the Rules (art. 2).",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/regulations-for-the-implementation-of-the-land-administration-law-of-the-peoples-republic-of-china-lex-faoc003422/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3562,Land & soil, Regulation,"Land tenure,Survey/mapping,Cadastre/land registration,Ownership,Expropriation,Use restrictions,Agricultural land,Public land,Land commission","Asia, ASIA AND THE PACIFIC, East Asian Seas, Eastern Asia, North Pacific, North-West Pacific",These Regulations shall enter into force on 1 February 1991 (art. 40).,ECOLEX_Legislation
