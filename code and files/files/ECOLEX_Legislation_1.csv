Communication from the Commission on the implementation of the Green Lanes under the Guidelines for border management measures to protect health and ensure the availability of goods and essential services.,2020.0,,"This text engages the principle that all EU internal borders should stay open and that supply chains for essential products must be guaranteed. The free flow of goods, especially in times of Covid-19 emergency and in the interest of all, requires that Member States respect and fully implement the Guidelines at all border-crossings at internal borders. This document is designed to help Member States implement the Guidelines as regards the green lanes. It is intended to engender a cooperative process across the EU to ensure all freight, including but not limited to essential goods such as food and medical supplies, gets quickly to its destination without any delays. In order to preserve the EU-wide operation of supply chains and ensure the functioning of the Single Market for goods, wherever internal border controls exist or have been introduced Member States are requested to designate immediately all the relevant internal border. Also crossing points of the trans-European transport network (TEN-T) and additional ones to the extent deemed necessary, as ‘green lane’ border crossings – for land (road and rail), sea and air transport. Going through these ‘green lane’ border crossings, including any checks and health screening of transport workers, should not exceed 15 minutes on internal land borders. The ‘green lane’ border crossings should be open to all freight vehicles carrying any type of goods. Member States should act immediately to temporarily suspend all types of road access restrictions in place in their territory (week-end bans, night bans, sectoral bans, etc.) for road freight transport and for the necessary free movement of transport workers. Transport workers, irrespective of their nationality and place of residence, should be allowed to cross internal borders. Restrictions such as travel restrictions and mandatory quarantine of transport workers, should be waived, without prejudice for competent authorities to take proportionate and specifically adapted measures to minimize the risk of contagion.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/communication-from-the-commission-on-the-implementation-of-the-green-lanes-under-the-guidelines-for-border-management-measures-to-protect-health-and-ensure-the-availability-of-goods-and-essential-services-lex-faoc194240/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=134,"Food & nutrition, General", Regulation,"Food security,Internal trade,International trade,Transport/storage,Public health,Risk assessment/management",,,ECOLEX_Legislation

The NAS's long-term vision is to make the agri-food sector a critical contributor to the achievement of food security and a key driver of resilience and transformation of the Lebanese economy into a productive economy. This can be achieved by following a twin-tracked approach that aims, on one side, at restoring the livelihoods and productive capacities of the farmers, producers, and all actors in the agri-food value chain, and, on the other side, at increasing the production and productivity to make agriculture a more profitable sector that contributes to reducing the import bill and enhancing the efficiency of the value chains and their competitiveness to increase agricultural exports, as well as ensuring sustainable management of natural resources and increasing the use of renewable energy to mitigate the impact of climate change. In order to pursue the NAS overall objective of transforming the Lebanese agri-food system making it more resilient, inclusive, competitive, and sustainable, the interventions are clustered around the following five pillars (1) restore the livelihoods and productive capacities of farmers and producers; (2) increase agricultural production and productivity; (3) enhance efficiency and competitiveness of agri-food value chains; (4) improve climate change adaptation, and sustainable management of agri-food systems and natural resources; and (5) strengthen the enabling institutional environment.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/lebanon-national-agriculture-strategy-nas-2020-2025-lex-faoc202167/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=158,"Agricultural & rural development, Livestock, Environment gen., Food & nutrition, Forestry, Cultivated plants, Water, Waste & hazardous substances, General", ,"Abandoned land/unoccupied land,Afforestation/reforestation,Agricultural development,Agricultural land,Aquaculture,Climate change,Cooperative/producer organization,Crops/grasses,Disasters,Early warning system/emergency intervention system,Fertilizers/nutrients,Financial agricultural measures,Fiscal and market measures,Food security,Food waste,Gender,Governance,Subsidy/incentive,Internal trade,International trade,Irrigation,Pesticides,Processing/handling,Protection of environment,Renewable energy,Smallholders/peasants,Sustainable development,Sustainable use,Capacity building,Nutrition,Packaging/labelling,Traceability/product tracing,Food quality control/food safety,Forest management/forest conservation,Animal feed/feedstuffs,Animal health,Pests/diseases,Quarantine,Vaccination,Planting material/seeds,Vegetables/legumes,Plant production,Waste non-domestic sources,Waste management,Monitoring,Pollution control,Waterworks,Freshwater quality/freshwater pollution","Mediterranean, Middle East, NEAR EAST AND NORTH AFRICA, Western Asia",2020 - 2025.,ECOLEX_Legislation

It contains a power to make secondary legislation to make corrections to that body of law to make it operable once the UK has left the EU. It also contains a discretionary power to enable amendments to be made, during 2020, to the law this Act domesticates if, for example, there are amendments to the equivalent European law that the Secretary of State or the devolved administrations wish to replicate. There is also a power for the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) to enable them to continue to move towards a uniform unit value of payment entitlements.

Federal Climate Protection Act,2019.0,Germany,"Germany’s Federal Climate Protection Act has 15 Articles and two Annexes. It specifies Germany’s plan to limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, preferably to 1.5 degrees Celsius and draws upon the Federal climate change goals, serving to keep to European Union targets and limits. According to the Act, a balance between environmental, social and economic consequences has been sought. The goal of limit global warming to 2 degrees Celsius, preferably 1.5 degrees Celsius stems from the Paris Agreement and the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). In accordance with the goals stipulated in the Act, Germany seeks to honor its commitments of the of the UN climate summit in New York of the 23rd September 2019 to pursue Greenhouse Gas neutrality by 2050. Section 2 of the Act deals with specific climate targets and maximum emission rates. Accordingly, greenhouse gas emissions should gradually be reduced in comparison to 1990. A reduction rate of at least 55 percent applies by the target year 2030. The Act may be amended, should the EU or international climate targets become more ambitious. Annex 2 stipulates the exact maximum yearly emission rates, while Annex 1 specifies sectors and corresponding sources of emissions. Sectors falling under the climate targets are the energy industry, general industry, transport, housing and buildings, agriculture, waste management and others. Where the greenhouse gas emission reduction targets are not reached in a certain industry, Germany claims the right to implement an “immediate action program” (“Sofortprogramm”) within three months to bring the rate of emissions back down to target rate. Climate reports are issued every year. A council shall be created on the basis of this Act, consisting of 5 impartial experts in the field appointed for a period of 5 years. The climate council’s main function is to monitor the greenhouse gas emission data and check the reduction of greenhouse gases. Further, the council advises the German government on 1. Changes in the annual emission quantities by ordinance according to § 4 paragraph 5; 2. Update of the climate protection plan; and 3. On the decisions on the climate protection programs according to § 9. The German Länder are entitled to take more ambitious commitments than the Federal commitments, if they wish to do so. The German Federal state vows to function as a role model in in achieving climate neutrality in Federal public administration by 2030.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/federal-climate-protection-act-lex-faoc192218/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=178,"Air & atmosphere, Environment gen., General", Legislation,"Climate change,Air quality/air pollution,Basic legislation,Emissions,Environmental standards,Pollution control","Alps, Europe, EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA, European Union Countries, North Sea, North-East Atlantic, Western Europe",Entry into force 18.12.2019,ECOLEX_Legislation
