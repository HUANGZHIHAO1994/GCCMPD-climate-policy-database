Ley Nº 15.020 - Ley sobre Reforma Agraria.,1962.0,Chile,"La Ley consta de 104 artículos y 8 artículos transitorios. Esta Ley constituye un avance en el desarrollo de la parcelación y división de tierras en Chile. La Caja de Colonización Agrícola, creada en 1928 y modernizada en 1960, ha acumulado experiencia en la división de tierras, especialmente del sector privado. Su cambio de nombre por el de Corporación de la Reforma Agraria, amplía el campo de acción de la Caja. Normas sobre expropiación, unidad económica familiar, cooperativas agrícolas obligatorias, asistencia técnica y crediticia al colono, etc, existen en la legislación chilena desde hace muchos años. Esta Ley da a la unidad económica un carácter más familiar, excluyendo en lo posible el empleo de mano de obra ajena al propietario y su familia. La Ley prevé la coordinación de los diversos organismos del sector público del sector a través del Consejo Superior de Fomento Agropecuario, cuya labor es de promoción de los planes de desarrollo económico. La Ley, que introduce importantes innovaciones en materia de expropiación, permite la expropiación de predios bien explotados siempre que se haga dentro del marco fijado por un plan de desarrollo general agrícola. Dentro de este tipo de expropiación se reserva al propietario expropiado el derecho de retener para sí, si lo desea, una parte del predio. Asimismo, permite la expropiación de tierras abandonadas o notoriamente mal explotadas; hasta el 50 por ciento de tierras que se rieguen mediante obras financiadas por el Estado, y los terrenos susceptibles de saneamiento. La Ley simplifica y agiliza los sistemas judiciales que resguardan al propietario frente a un posible abuso del sistema de expropiación.

Law No. VII of 1961 on forest and wildlife management and its implementing Decree No. 73 of 1981 of the Cabinet on the management of forests and wildlife.,1961.0,Hungary,"This is a comprehensive statute of forest management aiming to extend forests by reforestation, to produce good quality and competitive forest products; to contribute to soil conservation, water management and other useful purposes; to integrate hunting and wildlife management with the national economy. The Law differentiates between forests (for timber extraction, research purposes, protection forests and recreational forests, protected forests and for wildlife management purposes) and other woodlands whose surface area is less than half a hectare. The latter are destined for protection or agro-forestry purposes. Detailed provisions regarding forest redistribution, subdivision, administration and use are contained in section III. State-owned forests may be administered by State forestry organizations, by ministries or national authorities (provided this is done for specific purposes) or by municipal bodies if the forest does not serve prevalently felling purposes. Agricultural and fishing production cooperatives, specialized agricultural cooperatives and their associations, as proprietors or users, may carry out their activities in forests. Forest owners' associations are established by this Law as proprietors of their forests and as legal persons. Forest management shall be performed within the framework of State forestry structures. The creation of contiguous woodlands suitable for large-scale forestry is encouraged. New administrators (users) may be nominated directly. To avoid one proprietor having several small pieces of woodland in different areas, voluntary exchange between owners os provided for. If direct nomination or voluntary exchange is not possible, forest redistribution between administrators (users) or owners should be organized. Redistribution procedures are elaborated by municipal commissions and carried out by county land offices and the process is directed and supervised by the Minister. Changes occurring during redistribution should be registered in the land register. Protection forests and protected forests may not be exploited by production cooperatives. Forest owners' associations are supervised directly by county level special administrative organs. Members are entitled to proportional shares in profits. By-laws of such associations shall conform with requisites of the Ministry. Changes in crops cultivated and in users, as well as the subdivision of forests require authorization. Activities which can be performed by administrators (users) are listed in article 10 of the Law. Basic principles of forestry are set forth in section IV. These are: species suitable for the habitat of the area in question should be planted; clear-felling is allowed only in flat and slightly hilly land so as to avoid soil erosion; protection forests are those forests having special purposes such as soil conservation, water management, health care, military purposes etc. General rules of forestry and special provisions regarding protection forests are provided in this section. A ten-year forestry plan should be prepared by each forestry organization by an expert and authorized by the Minister. Annual plans are also to be prepared by administrators (users). Provisions relating to State forestry management and forest works are set forth in section V. State forestry authorities manage the forests of forest owners' associations within the framework of State forestry organization. The number of professional staff to be employed is determined on the basis of the size of the forest. Detailed rules of afforestation and tree planting are provided for in Section VI, with special regard to afforestation and tree planting for public interest. Section VII lays down provisions for the safeguard and protection of forests and other smaller woodlands. Safeguarding is the duty of the administrator (user) and he has to mark out clearly the boundaries. There are special provisions regarding forestry officers and forest guards, damages caused to woodlands, interference with proper use of forests, traffic on forest roads, protection against forest fires and sylvo-pastoralism (prohibited in protection forests). Section VIII deals with the transport of forest products and processing of timber. Sawing and panel industry are regulated in details in special provisions of law. Section IX, in particular, provides for wildlife management and hunting. The State has exclusive hunting rights over the entire national territory. Hunting rights can be given in concession or surrendered to individual hunters' associations or to the national federation of hunters' associations. These organs which are entitled to hunt can not convey hunting rights to others but can stipulate hunting contracts. They are obliged to safeguard hunting grounds and game stock. Damages caused by wild animals and indemnities are regulated in this section as well. Forestry management is regulated in Section X. The Ministry keeps a register of forests and other woodlands. Technical development is provided for in section XI. It includes yield increase and utilization of advanced working methods and procedures. Dissolution of forest owners' association is regulated in Section XII.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/law-no-vii-of-1961-on-forest-and-wildlife-management-and-its-implementing-decree-no-73-of-1981-of-the-cabinet-on-the-management-of-forests-and-wildlife-lex-faoc006508/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3912,"Forestry, Land & soil, Wild species & ecosystems", Legislation,"Basic legislation,Policy/planning,Forest management/forest conservation,Concession,Institution,Afforestation/reforestation,Timber extraction/logging,Forest service/forest officers,Classification/declassification,Authorization/permit,Cooperative/producer organization,Soil conservation/soil improvement,Cadastre/land registration,Management/conservation,Hunting authorization/permit,Hunting/capture","Eastern Europe, Europe, EUROPE AND CENTRAL ASIA, European Union Countries",,ECOLEX_Legislation

In order to attain these objectives, it is the intent of Congress to provide for (1) continuous research to improve the marketing, handling, storage, processing, transportation, and distribution of agricultural products; (2) cooperation among Federal and State agencies, producers, industry organizations, and others in the development and effectuation of research and marketing programs to improve the distribution processes; (3) an integrated administration of all laws enacted by Congress to aid the distribution of agricultural products through research, market aids and services, and regulatory activities, to the end that marketing methods and facilities may be improved, that distribution costs may be reduced and the price spread between the producer and consumer may be narrowed, that dietary and nutritional standards may be improved, that new and wider markets for American agricultural products may be developed, both in the United States and in other countries, with a view to making it possible for the full production of American farms to be disposed of usefully, economically, profitably, and in an orderly manner. In effectuating the purposes of this chapter, maximum use shall be made of existing research facilities owned or controlled by the Federal Government or by State agricultural experiment stations and of the facilities of the Federal and State extension services. To the maximum extent practicable marketing research work done under this chapter in cooperation with the States shall be done in cooperation with the State agricultural experiment stations; marketing educational and demonstrational work done under this chapter in cooperation with the States shall be done in cooperation with the State agricultural extension service; market information, inspection, regulatory work and other marketing service done under this chapter in cooperation with the State agencies shall be done in cooperation with the State departments of agriculture, and State bureaus and departments of markets.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/agricultural-marketing-act-of-1946-7-usc-ch-38-lex-faoc198953/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=3958,Agricultural & rural development, Legislation,"Financial agricultural measures,Agricultural commodities,Internal trade,Agricultural development,Rural employment,Research,Transport/storage,International trade,Extension","Americas, Arctic, East Pacific, North America, North Atlantic",,ECOLEX_Legislation
