Le PAN/LCD vise la promotion de façon simultanée des actions de lutte contre la désertification et des activités génératrices de revenus, en vue de lutter contre la pauvreté et de contribuer à la sécurité alimentaire. Par ailleurs, le PAN/LCD est articulé autour des principaux domaines d’actions suivants: la sauvegarde des écosystèmes du massif du Fouta Djallon et de ses extensions physiques; la lutte contre la pauvreté; la gestion rationnelle et intégrée des ressources naturelles ; la décentralisation et participation effective des acteurs à la base ; le Partenariat entre les acteurs. Fondé sur les principes de participation et son intégration dans les dispositifs de planification nationaux existants, le PAN/LCD se décline en cinq (5) sous-programmes qui sont: Amélioration du cadre juridique et institutionnel (Sous-programme 1); Renforcement des capacités des acteurs pour une meilleure utilisation des terres et une gestion durable des ressources forestières (Sous-programme 2); Mise en place d’un système de Suivi-Evaluation pour une amélioration de la connaissance du cadre de référence biophysique (Sous-programme 3); Aménagement participatif et gestion durable des forêts de la Guinée (Sous-programme 4); Reconstitution des écosystèmes dégradés et amélioration des systèmes de production (Sous-programme 5). Trois sous composantes (1; 2 et 3) concernent les actions structurantes et les deux autres (4 et 5) concernent les actions opérationnelles. En effet, les actions structurantes identifiées prioritairement concernent l’ensemble des régions naturelles et se rapportent à l’information, sensibilisation des populations; l’éducation environnementale; l’alphabétisation fonctionnelle ; l’appui à la formation; l’appui aux secteurs privés et aux organisations paysannes à travers un système de crédit; l’application de la législation et la réglementation et le renforcement des capacités des structures d’encadrement. Quant aux activités opérationnelles, elles regroupent toutes les interventions qui permettent de lutter de manière directe contre la désertification sur le terrain. L’échelle de programmation retenue est la région naturelle en ce sens qu’elle représente une unité écologique relativement homogène pouvant faciliter la conduite des actions prévues. Elle demeure à cet égard l’échelle la plus pertinente en matière de planification environnementale.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/programme-daction-national-de-lutte-contre-la-desertification-panlcd-juin-2006-lex-faoc147376/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=2391,"Agricultural & rural development, Forestry, Land & soil, Wild species & ecosystems", ,"Agricultural development,Processing/handling,Bioenergy,Governance,Non-timber products,Forest management/forest conservation,Public participation,Sustainable use,Poverty,Afforestation/reforestation,Desertification,Soil conservation/soil improvement,Biofuel,Ecosystem preservation","Africa, AFRICA FAO, Least Developed Countries, North Atlantic, Western Africa",,ECOLEX_Legislation

The process for the first time involved looking at effects of climate change as a threat mainly to the largely agrarian population that still depends on subsistence agriculture for their daily livelihood. Given past trends, the threat from GLOFs is now more than ever imminent due to evidence of temperature increases from the global warming; the incessant and frequent flooding and flash floods, especially in the summer of 2004 was a stark reminder of the deadly effects of climate change and environmental degradationas witnessed especially in the eastern regions of the country.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/bhutan-national-adaptation-programme-of-action-lex-faoc167555/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=2392,"Agricultural & rural development, Environment gen.", ,"Disasters,Capacity building,Sustainable development,Sustainable use,Poverty,Biodiversity,Gender,Food sovereignty,Cultural heritage,Climate change,Early warning system/emergency intervention system,Risk assessment/management,Ecosystem preservation","Asia, ASIA AND THE PACIFIC, Landlocked Developing Countries, Least Developed Countries, Southern Asia",,ECOLEX_Legislation

A member of a rural collective economic organization is entitled to contract the rural land of such rural collective economic organization. The Contractor shall obtain the right to land contractual management after the contract enters into effect.

"Ordonnance nº 2005-867 portant actualisation et adaptation du droit domanial, du droit foncier et du droit forestier applicables en Guyane.",2005.0,French Guiana (France),"La présente ordonnance complète le dispositif législatif en matière forestière et donne un fondement juridique à l'intervention de l'Office national des forêts (ONF) et aux actes de gestion durable : elle étend l'essentiel du code forestier à la Guyane, avec les adaptations et dispositions spécifiques rendues nécessaires par le contexte et les enjeux particuliers de la forêt guyanaise. Cette ordonnance va permettre de s'engager dans une démarche d'écocertification. Le code du domaine de l'Etat est également modifié pour tenir compte de ces adaptations. Les principales de ces adaptations et dispositions spécifiques sont les suivantes: - le champ d'application du régime forestier n'est pas la totalité du patrimoine forestier de l'Etat mais des périmètres définis par décrets (article L. 172-2 nouveau du code forestier); - actuellement, la forêt appartient au domaine privé de l'Etat. Afin de répondre à l'attente des collectivités territoriales, un dispositif de transfert à titre gratuit des forêts de l'Etat, à leur bénéfice, est rendu possible, sur demande motivée notamment par le rôle social ou environnemental que ces forêts jouent au plan local. Ces forêts tout comme les forêts domaniales relèveront du régime forestier (article L. 172-3 nouveau du code forestier); - un régime d'autorisation de prélèvements des produits végétaux de toute nature est instauré (article L. 172-5 nouveau du code forestier); - les communautés d'habitants qui tirent traditionnellement leurs moyens de subsistance de la forêt peuvent bénéficier de concessions ou de cessions de forêts appartenant à l'Etat ou aux collectivités territoriales (article L. 172-6 nouveau). L'utilisation de ces espaces forestiers s'exerce conformément aux principes de gestion durable (article L. 14 nouveau); - le défrichement, c'est-à-dire la destruction de l'état boisé dans le cadre d'un changement de destination d'une parcelle forestière, est soumis à autorisation, dans des périmètres définis par arrêté préfectoral, après enquête publique (article L. 362-1), et non sur tout le domaine forestier ; cette disposition vise à éviter une procédure lourde d'autorisation de défrichement sur les périmètres de mise en valeur agricole et sur les périmètres d'aménagement dont la vocation à terme n'est pas forestière.",https://www.ecolex.org/details/legislation/ordonnance-no-2005-867-portant-actualisation-et-adaptation-du-droit-domanial-du-droit-foncier-et-du-droit-forestier-applicables-en-guyane-lex-faoc053113/?type=legislation&xsubjects=Mineral+resources&page=2453,"Forestry, Land & soil", Legislation,"Forest management/forest conservation,Framework law,Classification/declassification,Environmental planning,Non-timber products,Traditional rights/customary rights,Authorization/permit,Community management,Public land,Agricultural land,Concession","Americas, Latin America and the Caribbean, LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN FAO, North Atlantic, South America",,ECOLEX_Legislation
