Austrian National Emissions Trading System,2022,Austria,"Austria launched its National Emissions Trading System (Nationales Emissionshandelssystem, or N-EHS) for heating and transport fuels in July 2022 as part of the eco-social tax reform of autumn 2021. This measure covers sectors beyond the EU ETS  and is set to accompany the existing energy taxes in Austria. Since GHG emissions from the country’s energy, heavy industry, and domestic aviation sectors are already covered by the EU ETS, the national ETS covers energy-related emissions from the buildings, transport, small industry, waste and agriculture sectors.   The “National Emissions Trading Act” (NEHG) 2022 sets the framework for the national ETS. The aim of this federal law is the gradual introduction of a cost-efficient and effective measure to reduce GHG emissions.   The Austrian national ETS will be phased in gradually, with a fixed price per tonne CO2e from 2022 to 2025. In 2026, auctioning will be introduced.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/122,National,"Fixed price between 1 July 2022 and 31 December 2025, auctioning foreseen from 2026","Waste,Transport,Buildings,Industry",CO2 only,No offsets allowed,Flexible cap in the fixed-price period,ICAP
Brazil,,Brazil,"Brazil’s National Climate Change Policy, enacted in December 2009, aims to promote the development of a Brazilian market for emissions reductions. By the end of 2021, the Presidency of the Republic put out for public consultation a draft law creating the National Policy on Climate Change and Green Growth, which would establish the objectives, principles, guidelines and instruments of the new Policy as well as the Interministerial Committee on Climate Change and Green Growth, the highest governance body of the climate change agenda in the country.  Two parallel and ongoing processes are considering the implementation of an ETS in Brazil. One is the “Consideration of Environmental Benefits in the Electricity Sector” under Law 14,120/2021, coordinated by the Energy Research Corporation (Empresa de Pesquisa Energética, EPE) and the Ministry of Mines and Energy, with the support of the International Energy Agency. In workshops organized by the EPE in 2021, stakeholders discussed the possibility of implementing an ETS in the power sector, as well as different design options.  Another process is the discussion of bills at the Brazilian National Congress, including Bill 528/2021. This bill would create the Brazilian Market of Emission Reductions and give the government a period of five years to develop regulations for the national program of emission reductions. One version of this bill, which is currently being discussed, would provide for an ETS in Brazil. In this context, several proposals from the private sector and civil society have also emerged around the establishment of an ETS in the country.  As part of its activities under the World Bank’s Partnership for Market Readiness (PMR), the Brazilian government had carried out studies on the possible implementation of market instruments to meet its mitigation targets and reduce overall mitigation costs. This included the development of design options, economic and regulatory impact assessments, as well as an analysis of potential interactions between carbon pricing instruments and existing policies.  Since 2013, a group of leading companies has been participating in a voluntary ETS simulation to gain experience and develop proposals for an ETS in Brazil. The ETS simulation, which remains ongoing, is coordinated by the Centro de Estudos em Sustentabilidade da Fundação Getulio Vargas.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/79,National,,,,,,ICAP
Canada - Nova Scotia,2019,Canada,"Nova Scotia’s cap-and-trade program sets a cap on the total amount of GHG emissions allowed in covered sectors in the province for the years 2019-2022 (compliance period). Final cap-and-trade program regulations were passed in November 2018. The program regulates the industry, power, heat (buildings), and transportation sectors and covers more than 80% of GHG emissions in Nova Scotia.   The Nova Scotia program was established to meet the federally set benchmark introduced in the “Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change” (see ‘Canada’ factsheet). This means that the province is not subject to the federal carbon pricing “backstop” measure.  Since May 2018, Nova Scotia has been a member of the Western Climate Initiative (WCI), which provides technical services and support for the province’s cap-and-trade program. It is not linked to any jurisdictions.  Nova Scotia’s “Environmental Goals and Climate Change Reduction Act” sets new targets to fight climate change, including a target of reaching 53% below 2005 levels by 2030, as well as net-zero emissions by 2050.

Chile,,Chile,"In June 2022, Chile published its “Framework Law on Climate Change”, which sets a 2050 carbon neutrality goal, as well as a description of the national, regional, and local climate policies that Chile will use to achieve it. These include Chile’s NDC, Long-Term Climate Strategy, Climate Change Financial Strategy, and sectoral mitigation and adaptation plans. The Long-Term Climate Strategy, presented in October 2021, specified that Chile would set an increasing trajectory for its carbon price to 2050 between 2025 and 2030, while also specifying that Chile seeks to have an integral and efficient carbon pricing portfolio to deliver coherent and predictable price signals. Chile has had a carbon tax in place since 2017.  Article 14 of the Law mandates the Ministry of Environment to specify GHG emission limits for a range of sources, based on a system of emission standards set by technology, sector, or activity. GHG emission limits may be set for individual installations or groups of these. If set in aggregate, GHG emission limits could be akin to a cap. Furthermore, according to Article 15, regulated entities who perform better than their standard are to have their surplus emission reductions certified, which may then be used by other regulated entities for compliance with their respective emission standards. Furthermore, GHG reduction or removal certificates from projects implemented within Chile may also be used for compliance with the emission standards. A dedicated registry would track the projects and transfers.  The specific design of the system of GHG emissions limits is not yet defined and could be implemented either as an ETS or as a tradable performance standard.   Moreover, Article 37 provides a basis for the development of market, fiscal, and financial-based instruments to internalize the environmental, social and economic costs of GHG emissions, and realize the benefits of abatement activities, risk reduction, and climate change adaptation. This article could lay the foundation for a future ETS.  Chile is set to continue its cooperation with the World Bank. Work is expected to focus on a roadmap for implementing the changes to the carbon tax, as well as on deepening the understanding of the role of carbon pricing in carbon neutrality, including Article 6 and the development of the cap-and-trade system contained in the draft Framework Law.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/54,National,,,,,,ICAP
China - Beijing pilot ETS,2013,China,"The Beijing Pilot ETS was launched in November 2013. Beijing is one of the two Chinese pilots with ETS regulation passed by its regional congress. The ETS covers ~24 % of the city’s total emissions, including those from: heat, cement, petrochemicals, and other industrial enterprises; manufacturers; the service sector; and public transport. The system covered electricity generation until 2020, after which it was integrated into the national ETS. In 2016, it lowered the inclusion thresholds from the original 10,000 tCO2/year to 5,000 tCO2 while adding the public transport sector. In 2020, Beijing also included the aviation sector in its mandatory reporting scheme, preparing the sector to be included in the carbon market without a specific timeline.  Beijing is the only regional pilot in China that uses a price floor (CNY 20.00 (USD 3.10)) and ceiling (CNY 150.00 (USD 23.26)) as a price stability mechanism. In cases of consecutively high or low average prices, the government can auction or buy back extra allowances. The Beijing pilot has seen a relatively high carbon price level, compared to the other ETS pilots in China. The Beijing pilot is also open to a range of market participants including compliance entities, institutional investors, and individuals.    Beijing also has pioneered cross-regional trading with its neighboring provinces. A “Framework Agreement for Cooperation on the Study of Cross-regional Carbon Emissions Trading” with Tianjin, Hebei, Inner Mongolia, Shaanxi, and Shandong, signed in 2013, provides a basis for cooperation. As a consequence of this, several cement companies from the Hebei province as well as companies from both the cement and power generation sectors voluntarily participated in the Beijing ETS in 2014 and 2015. Several companies from the same sectors in Inner Mongolia also voluntarily participated in 2015.  The Beijing Pilot ETS is managed by the Beijing Municipal Ecology and Environment Bureau (EEB), which became the competent authority for the ETS in 2019. Updated implementing legislation is contained in the “2018 Carbon Emission Management and Trading Plan”.    In addition, Beijing plays a supporting role in the national offset program.

China - Chongqing pilot ETS,2014,China,"Chongqing launched its pilot ETS in June 2014; to date, it has concluded seven compliance years.  The Ecology and Environment Bureau (EEB) of Chongqing is responsible for the ETS.  The system covers electrolytic aluminum, ferroalloys, calcium carbide, cement, caustic soda, and iron and steel, and other industrial sectors. The power sector was covered until 2019, after which it transitioned to the national ETS. In April 2020, the Chongqing EEB released a notice on its ETS work for compliance year 2019, with a list of covered entities attached. The 152 enterprises covered by the system accounted for ~51%* of the city’s total carbon emissions in 2020. The latest publicly available allocation plan dates from 2019 and is for the 2018 compliance year. Among the eight Chinese pilots, the Chongqing ETS is the only one that covers non-CO2 gases.   Another unique feature of the Chongqing Pilot ETS, compared to the other Chinese pilots, is that it has a clear path for cap-setting in which an annual reduction rate is set and applied to the base-year emissions level (i.e., the sum of each covered entity’s highest annual emissions of the year from 2008 to 2012). From 2013 to 2015, the annual reduction rate was 4.13% and thereafter 4.85%.   The latest publicly available Chongqing allocation plan for the 2018 compliance year differed from those of other Chinese pilots in that allowances were allocated based on entities’ self-reported demand. Adjustments are made when an entity’s self-reported demand level exceeds its highest historical annual emissions (2008-2012), by using the average of the two numbers. In addition, if the sum of the allocation for all the entities exceeds the top-down cap, a reduction factor is applied across the board. 2018 was the second consecutive year where the cap (97 MtCO2e) was lower than the sum of the allocation based on self-declared demanded amount (106 MtCO2e); hence, the allocation was subject to a downward adjustment. Since then, no detailed allocation plan has been publicly released.     * There is no official data, so emissions coverage given here is an estimate. Coverage for 2019 was estimated at ~62%,  when power sector was still under the Chongqing ETS.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/56,SubNational,Free Allocation (Grandparenting) and Auctioning,Industry,"CO2, CH4, N2O, HFCs, PFCs, SF6",Domestic,78.39 MtCO2e (2020),ICAP
China - Fujian pilot ETS,2016,China,"The province of Fujian launched its ETS in September 2016; it is the eighth regional pilot ETS in China. To date, it has achieved full compliance in its five compliance years. The system covers nine sectors: electricity grid, petrochemicals, chemicals, building materials, iron and steel, nonferrous metals, paper, aviation, and ceramics. The ETS covered electricity generation until 2019, after which it was incorporated into the national ETS.   Given the prominence of the forestry sector in Fujian, its ETS pilot has a special focus on carbon sinks. In 2017, the Fujian government outlined a plan to promote forestry offsets projects in the province. By the end of 2020, 2.8 million tonnes of forestry offset credits had traded in the Fujian ETS, with a total turnover of over CNY 40 million (USD 6.2 million), overachieving the province’s target of forestry offsets set in 2017.  Unlike other Chinese pilots, which were mandated by the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), the mandate for the Fujian ETS came from the State Council with the endorsement of the “National Ecological Civilization Pilot Area (Fujian) Implementation Plan”. The NDRC approved the Haixia Equity Exchange in Fujian as one of nine trading platforms for trading Chinese Certified Emission Reductions (CCERs), demonstrating NDRC’s recognition of the regional market.    In early 2019, the ETS-related responsibilities in Fujian completed the transition from the Fujian DRC to the Fujian Provincial Department of Ecology and Environment (DEE), as a result of broader governance restructuring across China. In August 2020, the Fujian DEE amended the “Interim Measures for the Administration of Carbon Emissions Trading in Fujian Province”, fine-tuning its reporting, verification, and market oversight system.  According to the Chinese national ETS rules, power sector entities that are overlapping between Fujian and the national ETS were covered under the regional carbon market in 2019 and moved to the national one from 2020 onwards. In the short term, the existing Chinese regional carbon markets are expected to operate in parallel to the national carbon market. Over the medium to long term, they are expected to be integrated into the national market, once it is fully operational.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/87,SubNational,Free Allocation (Grandparenting; Benchmarking) and Auctioning,"DomesticAviation,Industry",CO2,National and provincial,~126 MtCO2 (2020),ICAP
China - Guangdong pilot ETS,2013,China,"Launched in December 2013, the Guangdong Pilot ETS has concluded eight compliance years to date with high compliance rates. It is the largest of the Chinese ETS pilots in terms of market size. Following several scope expansions since 2016, the ETS covers cement, steel, petrochemical, paper, and domestic aviation sectors, accounting for about 40%* of the province’s carbon emissions. The ETS covered electricity generation until 2020, after which it was integrated into the national ETS. The system expects to further expand in 2022 (see ‘Year in Review’ below).   The Guangdong Pilot ETS has one of the most active markets among the Chinese pilots, with the largest spot trading volume. By the end of December 2021, the Guangdong pilot had traded a total of 199.69 million allowances, worth over CNY 4.61 billion (USD 0.71 billion). From 2019 to 2020, the spot trading volume in the Guangdong ETS exceeded the EUA spot trading on the European Energy Exchange (EEX) for the same period.    Guangdong was the first pilot to introduce auctioning as one of the key allocation methods. It was mandatory for enterprises to purchase 3% of their allowances at auction in 2013 before receiving the remainder for free. Since 2014, participation in auctions has been voluntary and the share of allowances allocated for free is 95% for the power sector and 97% for the remaining sectors, with some modifications in 2020 and 2021 (see ‘Allowance Allocation’ below).** Since 2017, auctions have been held on an ad hoc basis.   Guangdong has introduced new trading methods of allowance transaction for the secondary market in recent years to enhance further market liquidity. In June 2020, a so-called ‘bidding transfer’ was introduced, in which covered entities entrust the China Emissions Exchange (Guangzhou) (CEEX) to organize auctions of their allowances instead of pursuing bilateral trading.   Guangdong is among the few pilots that are open to foreign investors. Guangdong also allows unincorporated organizations, such as securities companies and trusts, to trade in its carbon market. As of January 2022, it has 132 institutional investors participating, accounting for over 65% of total trading volume.    As a result of the governance restructuring across China, the ETS-related responsibilities in Guangdong transitioned in 2018 from the Development and Reform Commission to the Department of Ecology and Environment (DEE).     * There is no publicly available data for the recent years and the data here is estimated by local experts. For 2020 (with power generation entities still under the Guangdong ETS) the coverage is estimated to be 65%.   ** This has been slightly modified for the 2020 compliance year for the aviation sector, which receives 100% free allocation.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/57,SubNational,Free Allocation (Grandparenting; Benchmarking) and Auctioning,"DomesticAviation,Industry",CO2,National and provincial,265 MtCO2 (2021),ICAP
China - Hubei pilot ETS,2014,China,"Launched in April 2014, the Hubei Pilot ETS has since concluded seven compliance years. It covers a broad range of industrial sectors and has expanded its scope several times. The ETS covered the power sector until 2019, which was subsequently integrated into the national ETS. In 2016, it lowered the thresholds of seven sectors from 60,000 to 10,000 tce. In 2017, it further lowered the thresholds of all the other sectors to 10,000 tce. In 2018, the water supply sector was added. As of 2019, the system covers more than 373 entities and ~27%* of the province’s CO2 emissions.   Hubei has been one of the most active regional markets in China in terms of trading and has the second-largest market size in terms of spot trading volume, after Guangdong. It is also one of the regional pioneers for allowance spot forward trading in China.** When spot forward trading is also considered, Hubei has the largest market as of the end of 2021, with a total secondary market transaction volume of 365 million tonnes and value of CNY 8.65 billion (USD 1.34 billion). Hubei allows foreign institutional and individual investors to participate in its carbon market.   A government reserve with 8% of the total cap is available for market stabilization, and the government can also intervene in cases of market fluctuations, severe supply-demand imbalances, or for liquidity reasons..   In early 2019, the ETS-related responsibilities in Hubei completed the transition from DRC to the Department of Ecology and Environment (DEE) of Hubei, as a result of the governance restructuring across China  Hubei also plays an important role in the national ETS: in December 2017, Hubei was selected to lead the development of the registry for the national ETS, which has been operated by the China Hubei Emission Exchange since the national ETS began.      * There is no official data, so emissions coverage given here is an estimate. Coverage for 2019 was estimated at ~45%.  ** China is still in the exploratory and research stage of carbon futures trading; according to the “Administrative Regulations on Futures Trading” document, futures can only be traded on approved professional futures exchanges.

China National ETS,2021,China,"China’s national ETS – the world’s largest in terms of covered emissions – started operating in 2021. It builds on the successful experience of pilot carbon markets implemented in eight regions. The objective of the ETS is to contribute to the effective control and gradual reduction of carbon emissions and, as confirmed as part of the 1+N policy framework in October 2021, will be an important policy measure to achieve China’s targets to peak emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060. The ETS regulates more than 2,000 companies from the power sector (including combined heat and power, as well as captive power plants in other sectors), which emit more than 26,000 tCO2 per year. The Chinese national ETS is estimated to cover more than 4 billion tCO2, accounting for over 40% of national carbon emissions. It is an intensity-based system with ex-post adjustments to the cap based on actual production levels. Compliance obligations are currently limited and vary between different types of power generation. The system will expand to other sectors over time and fine-tune its policy design and implementation. The existing Chinese regional ETS pilots are gradually transitioning into the national ETS. In the short term, the pilots will continue to operate in parallel to the national market, covering the sectors and entities not included in the national market. Over the medium to long term, as more sectors are included in the national ETS, entities already covered by regional systems are expected to be integrated into the national market. Originally under the responsibility of the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), in 2018 the climate change policy portfolio (including the development of the ETS) was shifted to the newly-established Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE). Interim regulations published in 2021 elaborated on the governance structure of the ETS, which, while remaining centered on the MEE, would grant authority to other national-level regulators as well as envisage cooperation between the MEE and other government entities in supervising market operations and compliance procedures.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/55,National,Free Allocation (Benchmarking),Power,CO2,Domestic,"~4,500 MtCO2 (2019 and 2020 each)",ICAP
China - Shanghai pilot ETS,2013,China,"Shanghai was the second Chinese region to start its pilot ETS, in November 2013. The pilot covers more than half* of the city’s emissions, including industry and non-industrial sectors such as buildings, aviation, and shipping. The system covered electricity generation until 2020, after which it was integrated into the national ETS. It is the only pilot that has achieved a 100% compliance rate continuously since its launch.  In 2016, Shanghai expanded its ETS coverage by adding shipping and more industrial sectors, as well as by lowering the participation threshold of existing power plants and participant industries to 10,000 tCO2 per year.   Shanghai is the most active among the Chinese pilots in terms of offset credits trading. It also pioneered allowance spot forward trading in China. In January 2017, the Shanghai Environmental and Energy Exchange (SEEE) and the Shanghai Clearing House jointly launched an over-the-counter Shanghai Emission Allowance Forward contract, with central counterparty clearing, as an innovative financial product that serves a purpose similar to carbon financial derivatives.** By the end of September 2021, the Shanghai carbon market had traded a total of 173 million tonnes of spot products, with a cumulative transaction volume of about CNY 2 billion (USD 310 million), while also handling the highest trading volume of offsets credits. Shanghai has carried out various other carbon finance innovations such as repurchases, carbon funds, carbon trusts, CCER pledge loans, green bonds, and carbon margin trading.   In early 2019, the ETS-related responsibilities in Shanghai completed the transition from the Development and Reform Commission (DRC) to the Ecology and Environment Bureau (EEB), as a result of the governance restructuring across China.  In December 2017, Shanghai was selected to lead the development of the trading platform for the national ETS. Since July 2021, the trading platform operated by the SEEE has been the dedicated avenue for allowances trading in the national ETS.      * The coverage rate would reduce significantly in 2020 given the transfer of power generation entities into national ETS but there is no publicly available data.  ** China is still in the exploratory and research stage of carbon futures trading and, according to the “Administrative Regulations on Futures Trading” document, futures contracts can only be traded on approved professional futures exchanges.

China - Shenzhen pilot ETS,2013,China,"The Shenzhen Pilot ETS began in June 2013 and was the first of the Chinese pilots to start operation. As a city of Guangdong province (that has its own separate ETS pilot), Shenzhen is the only Chinese pilot at the sub-province level, and it covers a broad scope across the energy, industry, building, and transport sectors.* The Shenzhen Pilot ETS covers a total of 687 entities. Mainly based on free allocation, Shenzhen’s allocation plans have not been made publicly available since 2016. A unique feature of this pilot ETS is its legal basis: although the majority of pilots are regulated by subnational government orders by the executive body of the government, the Shenzhen Pilot ETS is regulated by a dedicated ETS bill passed by its municipal legislator, the Shenzhen People’s Congress. This provides more legal stability.   Shenzhen is one of the most active regional markets in China, despite its relatively small size compared to other pilots. By the end of 2021, Shenzhen’s cumulative trading volume and turnover amounted to 65.17 million tonnes and CNY 1.46 billion (USD 230 million) respectively, one of the few pilots to surpass CNY 1 billion (USD 167 million). The Shenzhen ETS pilot is open to diversified market participants, including covered entities and institutional as well as individual (domestic and foreign) investors. Shenzhen has carried out various carbon finance innovations such as repurchases and allowance pledge loans.   Shenzhen also has pioneered cross-regional cooperation. In 2014, Shenzhen and Baotou signed the “Memorandum of Strategic Cooperation on the Construction of Carbon Trading Systems”. As a consequence of this, six companies in Baotou City of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region were covered by the Shenzhen Pilot ETS on a voluntary basis for one compliance year starting in June 2016.

Covered entities accounted for 50-60%* of the city’s total emissions in 2020.    The Tianjin Ecology and Environment Bureau (EEB) is responsible for the governance of the Tianjin Pilot ETS since 2019, taking over from the Development and Reform Commission. Since then, Tianjin has further enhanced the legal foundation of its ETS and continuously improved its market performance.   In 2020, the Tianjin municipal government released the latest version of the “Tianjin Interim Measures for the Administration of Carbon Emissions Trading”, which is a regulatory document released every few years providing the legal basis for the regional carbon market. The latest iteration extends the Tianjin Pilot ETS until the end of June 2025 and introduces the following main changes:   adding air pollution control as one of the purposes;  	explicitly excluding covered entities under the operational national ETS from the Tianjin Pilot ETS; and  	strengthening enforcement measures: companies failing to surrender enough allowances to match their emissions will face double the amount of the shortfall deducted from the next year’s allocation, and third-party verifiers found to not comply with regulations will be banned for three years.  Tianjin also introduced auctioning gradually and has seen more active trading recently. In 2019, a successful auction was held for the first time. In 2020 and 2021, Tianjin ETS held two auctions in each compliance year.   Tianjin’s market size for China Certified Emission Reductions (CCERs) and allowances has also increased significantly in the past years.

Colombia,,Colombia,"In 2018, Colombia adopted a law for climate change management, which outlines provisions for the establishment of a “National Program of Greenhouse Gas Tradable Emission Quotas” (Programa Nacional de Cupos Transables de Emisión de Gases de Efecto Invernadero – PNCTE).   The law outlines the basic provisions for the PNCTE. The Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (Minambiente) will determine the number of allowances, in line with Colombia’s national mitigation targets. Minambiente is also in charge of allocation, which will take place primarily via auctions. Non-compliance is to be punishable by a fine of up to two times the auction price. Auction revenues will be directed to the National Environmental Fund and will be used for GHG reductions and mitigation projects, as well as to manage implementation of the law. The bill also includes crediting provisions: voluntary actions of non-regulated entities that generate GHG emissions reductions or removals could be issued allowances if they are verified, certified, registered in the National Emission Reductions Registry (Registro nacional de reducción de emisiones de GEI – Renare), and deemed eligible for the program.  The PNCTE will complement other mitigation instruments, such as the country’s existing USD 5/tonne carbon tax and its offsetting program, both of which have been in place since 2017. The 2018 Climate Change Law states that the government may recognize carbon tax payments as part of the compliance obligation of regulated entities under the PNCTE.   The ETS design is currently being analyzed by the government. The “Climate Action Law” (Ley de Acción Climática), which came into force in December 2021, consolidates the commitments presented in Colombia’s NDC and sets a goal to fully implement the ETS by 2030. This law has also set an obligation for legal persons to report direct and indirect GHG emissions, following criteria to be set by Minambiente. It also appoints an independent group of experts (the Study Commission) to generate recommendations and promote and develop carbon markets in Colombia.

Introduced in 2005 and now in its fourth trading phase, the EU ETS is the oldest system in force. Since 2005, stationary installations have cut emissions by around 43%.    Since its launch, the EU ETS has gone through several reforms. The latest revision of the system’s framework was completed in 2018 and took effect in January 2021, for phase 4.

EU Emissions Trading System for buildings and road transport,,Austria,"The European Commission proposed the new ETS for buildings and road transport to address growing emissions from these sectors in a cost-effective way. The system would complement Member States’ national emissions reduction targets under the “Effort Sharing Regulation”. It would be separate from the existing EU ETS for energy, industry, and intra-EEA aviation sectors.   The new ETS would cover upstream emissions from fuels used in buildings and road transport. It would regulate fuel suppliers rather than end-consumers. The proposed framework includes a cap and a linear reductions factor to control the emissions reduction trajectory, as well as a market stability reserve to adjust the supply of allowances accordingly.  The system is proposed to start operating in 2026. Allowances would be distributed only via auctioning. Auction volumes would be front loaded to ensure a smooth start of the system and sufficient liquidity.   To address social impacts of carbon pricing in the sectors, the European Commission proposed to introduce the Social Climate Fund. A quarter of revenues from the new ETS would be directed to this instrument to support vulnerable groups, and mitigate energy and mobility poverty, with complementary financing from Member States. In addition, the Commission proposed that Member States use the entirety of revenues from emissions trading (both this new and the existing ETS) on climate and energy projects.   The eventual form of these proposals and their details are subject to the negotiations in the Council of the EU and the European Parliament.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/118,National,,"Transport,Buildings",,,,ICAP
Finland,,Finland,"In March 2021, the Ministry of Transport and Communications in Finland set up a cross-sectoral working group tasked with assessing and preparing for a national ETS to cover the road transport sector. The system’s objective would be to contribute to the government’s goal to halve transport emissions by 2030 compared to 2005 levels.  After the European Commission presented the EU “Fit for 55” package in July 2021, the working group broadened its focus from assessing the option of a national system to considering the proposal for a second EU-level ETS for buildings and road transport. A draft memorandum prepared by the working group contains an overview of the design elements, potential compensatory measures and a roadmap for the implementation of the national system, taking into account the Commission proposal for a second EU-level ETS. The draft was open for public consultation between November and December 2021.  The draft memorandum presents the results of the analysis of the working group, with a final decision by the government on the topic still pending. The draft memorandum observes that both systems are very similar and that a national system could only be introduced in full in 2026, the start year also proposed for the EU system. It concludes that the introduction of a national system would not be required if already-expected national measures (as specified in the “Roadmap to fossil-free transport”) and the EU-level ETS for buildings and road transport are implemented.  However, it presents two transitional options to hedge the risk of delays or lack of agreement on a second ETS at EU-level: a “fixed-price” ETS, similar to that of Germany, or an “emissions trading levy”/ ”fuel tax” that would be implemented as an increase of excise duties. According to the memorandum, these would allow for the introduction of a pricing instrument in Finland before the start of the EU system at relatively low cost. In case an EU system does not materialize, these could then transition into a full auction-based ETS at national level.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/120,National,,Transport,,,,ICAP
German National Emissions Trading System,2021,Germany,"Germany launched its National Emissions Trading System (in German: Nationales Emissionshandelssystem, or nEHS) for heating and transport fuels in 2021. This measure complements the EU ETS and forms part of the ‘Climate Action Programme 2030,’ a package of measures adopted by the German Federal Cabinet to reach Germany’s 2030 climate targets and aim for climate neutrality by 2050. Because GHG emissions from the country’s energy, industry, and domestic aviation sectors are already covered by the EU ETS, the introduction of the national ETS leads to most major sectors in Germany facing a CO2 price from 2021 onwards. After the release of the ‘Cornerstones for the Design of a National ETS’ in October 2019, the implementing legislation for the nEHS—the ‘Fuel Emissions Trading Act’—was adopted in December 2019 and amended in November 2020. The national ETS will be phased in gradually, with a fixed price per tCO2 from 2021 to 2025. In 2026, auctions with minimum and maximum prices will be introduced.

Indonesia,,Indonesia,"A presidential regulation that provides a national framework for carbon pricing instruments, including an ETS, was signed in October 2021. This regulation extends the “Government Regulation on Environmental Economic Instruments”, which provided a first mandate for an emissions and/or waste permit trading system to be implemented by 2024 (within seven years from its passage). The ETS will eventually work as a hybrid “cap-trade-and-tax” system alongside a carbon tax to be imposed from April 2022, which was regulated in the “Law of the Harmonization of Tax Regulations”. Once the mandatory ETS is in place, facilities that fail to meet their obligations under the system will be subject to the tax, the rate of which will be linked to the price of the domestic carbon market.  These developments follow a period of intense preparation. The MRV guidelines for the power sector were released in mid-2018 based on inputs from a study outlining the emissions profiles and marginal abatement cost curves of the power and industry sectors, in addition to completing the design and governance framework of an MRV system. Following this, an online GHG reporting platform for electricity generators and a pilot MRV program for electricity generators in the Java-Madura-Bali grid (covering ~70% of Indonesia’s electricity demand) were launched in late 2018. The Ministry of Industry has also developed an online GHG emissions reporting system. Pilot MRV programs are being conducted in the cement and fertilizer sectors.  A study completed in late 2018 examined four market-based instrument options: an ETS for the power and industry sectors; energy efficiency certificates for industry; a cap-and-tax system; and a carbon offset mechanism. Based on the study and stakeholder consultations, an ETS scenario was selected for further development, and a voluntary pilot was conducted for the power sector in 2021.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/104,National,,,,,,ICAP
Japan,,Japan,"The possible expansion of carbon pricing policies beyond the country’s existing carbon tax has been under consideration in Japan for a number of years. Since 2017, several expert committees in Japan have emphasized the key role of a carbon price in decarbonizing the economy.   Following the country’s updated NDC setting a target to reduce GHG emissions in Japan to net zero by 2050, then-Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga instructed the Ministry of the Environment (MoE) and the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry (METI) to set up working groups outlining plans for carbon pricing. In August 2021, both ministries issued their interim reports. MoE’s proposes a carbon tax with an eventual rate sufficient to trigger abatement across the economy and raise revenue for supporting technology innovation and diffusion, though it should start low. It also proposes an ETS that scales up auctioning in the early 2030s, with access to voluntary markets. METI’s interim report from the “Study Group on Ideal Economic and Other Approaches for Achieving Worldwide Carbon Neutrality” outlines developing existing domestic credit markets and infrastructure for carbon pricing as part of the future policy response.   In parallel, Japan operates the Advanced Technologies Promotion Subsidy Scheme with Emission Reduction Targets (ASSET) Program, which functions as a voluntary cap-and-trade program. To receive an ASSET subsidy, entities establish a reduction target based on historical emissions and propose new technologies to reach these targets. Entities that implement such technologies and achieve their target are granted the ASSET subsidy. Entities unable to meet their target on their own are permitted to purchase either credits from other participating entities, or so-called “J-Credits”. The government administers the voluntary J-Credit Scheme, where energy saving, renewable energy, and domestic forest management mitigation activities are verified as tradable J-Credits.  Japan is also implementing the Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM), a bilateral offset crediting mechanism to incentivize low-carbon technologies in 17 partner countries (Mongolia, Bangladesh, Kenya, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Vietnam, Lao PDR, Cambodia, Maldives, Palau, Costa Rica, Mexico, Chile, Saudi Arabia, Myanmar, Thailand, and the Philippines).   From 2022, the government is also working on the detailed design for the implementation of the Green Transformation (GX) League, a baseline-and-credit system for companies setting voluntary targets.

It covers direct emissions of six GHGs as well as indirect emissions from electricity consumption. The K-ETS is meant to play an essential role in meeting Korea’s 2030 updated NDC target.  The legal base for green growth and implementation of the K-ETS is the “Framework Act on Low Carbon, Green Growth” (2010). The “Act on Allocation and Trading of Greenhouse Gas Emissions Allowances” (Emissions Trading Act) and its Enforcement Decree, passed in 2012, stipulate government actions, institutions, and timelines for the K-ETS.

Montenegro ,,Montenegro,"In December 2019, the “Law on Protection from the Negative Impacts of Climate Change” entered into force in Montenegro. The law mandates the development of a comprehensive set of climate policies including a GHG inventory, a low-carbon development strategy, and a national MRV system. It further sets the legal basis for a national ETS for industry and the power sector.  A bylaw specific to the ETS, the “Decree on activities for which a GHG permit is issued”, was adopted in February 2020. The regulation determines sectoral coverage and inclusion thresholds, rules governing trade of permits, allocation rules for auctions, benchmarking and grandparenting, and a market stabilization reserve. It further includes provisions for banking allowances, a minimum reserve price of EUR 24 (USD 28.39), and a linear reduction factor for the emissions cap of 1.5% annually between 2020–2030. Revenue from auction proceeds would go to the Environmental Protection Fund to finance climate innovation, renewable energy, and environmental protection.  Montenegro has been an EU candidate country since 2010 and is required to bring its environmental and climate change policy in line with the EU as part of accession talks (under Chapter 27 of “the acquis”) that began in late 2018.

"Taiwan, China",,"Taiwan, Province of China","In July 2015, Taiwan, China enacted the “Greenhouse Gas Reduction and Management Act” (the Act) which legislates a 50% emissions reduction target for 2050 compared to 2005 GHG levels. The Act also mandates the setting of regulatory mitigation goals in stages. In this context, the Act stipulates that the Taiwanese Environmental Protection Administration (TEPA) will implement a domestic cap-and-trade scheme by considering the UNFCCC and its agreements, or relevant decisions by international conventions. This is further referred to in the “Climate Change Action Guideline 2017”.   The Act also mandated TEPA to develop the “GHG Reduction Action Plan”, which outlines details on how to implement the mitigation policies. It includes five-year regulatory goals for both national and sectoral GHG emissions, as well as implementation strategies in the form of eight policy packages. Published in March 2018, the plan proposes to implement a cap-and-trade system, calculate baseline emissions, and set up regulations – albeit without a precise timeline. On this basis, the central industry competent authorities of the six major sectors (energy, manufacturing, transportation, residential and commercial buildings, agriculture, and environment) approved the “GHG Emissions Control Action Programs” in October 2018.   A series of subsidiary regulations have been formulated. Mandatory emissions reporting for entities with annual emissions above 25,000 tCO2e from certain sectors has been ongoing since 2014. Subsidiary regulations also include the “2018 Regulations Governing GHG Offset Program Management”, which provide an opportunity for enterprises to acquire carbon offset credits.    Since the beginning of 2021, TEPA has been revising the Act. In July 2021, TEPA established a new internal climate change office to accelerate relevant legal amendments to keep pace with the EU and international carbon reduction trends. In late October 2021, the draft revision of the Act was published for public consultation and renamed the “Climate Change Response Act”.  It proposed a new carbon fee for domestic emissions, covering potentially both direct and indirect emissions, with revenues to be used to support domestic climate mitigation and the transition to a low carbon economy. The carbon fee would allow the use of domestic offsets. In addition, in response to the international trend of promoting carbon border adjustment mechanisms to avoid carbon leakage, it would also propose a new scheme of levying carbon fees on imported products with high carbon content.   After public consultation, the “Climate Change Response Act” is expected to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan in the first half of 2022 for further review and finalization. Further details of the carbon fee and ETS will be developed via sub-laws.

From 2021 onwards, the MRV procedures as adopted in the framework law on MRV have to be applied by regulated installations. By the end of March 2022, covered installations must submit the first monitoring reports for 2021. To establish its ETS, Ukraine plans to develop separate legislation based on at least three years of data from the MRV system. According to a statement made by the Minister of Environmental Protection and Natural Resources in January 2021, the ETS launch could be in 2025.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/74,National,,,,,,ICAP
United Kingdom,2021,United Kingdom,"The UK Emissions Trading Scheme (UK ETS) started in January 2021. Many design elements of the new system mirror those in phase 4 of the EU ETS, in which the UK had participated since 2005. The UK ETS covers energy-intensive industries, the power sector, and aviation within the UK and European Economic Area (EEA), together making up about one-third of the UK’s GHG emissions.   The scheme’s cap is 5% below the UK’s notional share of the EU ETS cap (i.e., the EUAs that would have been available to the UK government for allocation) and declines by 4.2 Mt per year initially. To ensure market stability, the system has a Cost Containment Mechanism (CCM) and – quite distinct from the EU ETS – a transitional Allowance Reserve Price of GBP 22 (USD 30.26). To safeguard competitiveness and minimize the risk of carbon leakage, a share of allowances will be freely allocated to emissions-intensive trade-exposed (EITE) sectors using an approach similar to phase 4 of the EU ETS.   The UK government remains open to the possibility of linking the UK ETS to other systems, but no decision has been made on the preferred linking partners. Phase 1 of the UK ETS will run until 2030. The entire scheme is due to be reviewed in 2023 and 2028, with ongoing reforms and developments of specific elements in the meantime.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/99,National,Free allocation (Benchmarking) and Auctioning,"DomesticAviation,Industry,Power","CO2, N2O, PFCs",,151.4 MtCO2e (2022),ICAP

It complements RGGI to help ensure that Massachusetts achieves its mandatory mitigation targets. Electricity generators in the state must comply, i.e. hold and surrender allowances, with both RGGI and the Massachusetts program.  In 2016, a ruling by the Massachusetts Supreme Court established that the Massachusetts government would need to take additional action to guarantee it meets the state’s climate targets — a 45% reduction by 2030 and an 80% reduction by 2050 (compared to 1990). In response to the ruling, the regulation “310 CMR 7.74” was adopted that required Massachusetts to establish a statewide cap-and-trade program, in addition to its existing participation in RGGI, to control emissions located specifically in Massachusetts. The regulation is intended to ensure that emission reductions associated with other clean energy programs occur in Massachusetts.   In 2020, the Massachusetts Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs signed a determination of statewide emissions limits, establishing a mid-century statewide net zero GHG emissions limit.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/101,SubNational,Auctioning,Power,CO2,,8.0 MtCO2 (2022),ICAP

Over the course of 2021, state agencies continued to evaluate climate actions, including the option for a future market-based program potentially through cooperating with other states that already operate cap-and-trade programs.   The New Mexico Environment Department is in the process of adopting California’s Advanced Clean Car standards, aimed at cutting transport emissions. The state has also implemented incentives for sustainable building and clean hydrogen production and distribution, as well as implemented standards to reduce carbon intensity in transportation fuels.

USA - New York City,,USA,"As part of a local law that sets emissions-intensity limits for most large buildings starting in 2024, the New York City (NYC) Mayor’s Office of Sustainability (MOS) in 2021 published the results of a study assessing the feasibility of a citywide trading program. The trading program would be supplemental to Local Law 97 (LL97).  LL97, one part of the” Climate Mobilization Act of 2019”, requires most buildings over 25,000 square feet (2,323 square meters) to meet annual emissions-intensity limits based on occupancy type. If the owner of a covered building exceeds their specified limit, they will be liable for a civil penalty equal to USD 268 per metric ton of CO2e in excess of their cap. Buildings in which more than 35% of the dwelling units are rent regulated have an alternate compliance pathway, which includes implementing a list of prescriptive energy conservation measures. After LL97 takes effect in 2024, the cap will become progressively stricter until 2050.  LL97 does not inherently provide for emissions credit trading between regulated building owners. However, in accordance with the requirement to study the feasibility of a citywide trading scheme as an alternative compliance pathway, NYC MOS published the corresponding results and recommendations in June 2021. The study assessed and outlined two trading program proposals to advance NYC’s policy goals and compared them to the implementation of LL97 without the trading aspect. Proposal #1 focuses on an auction system, while Proposal #2 analyzes a decentralized allocation of credits.  The feasibility study found that, when compared with LL97 implementation without trading, the suggested trading programs for NYC buildings could yield more efficient GHG reductions, greater investment in the local economy and less local air pollution.  If NYC opts to progress with a trading program, it will require new legislation at the local level. Should the city decide to pursue Proposal 1, it would also require State legislative authorization to implement the suggested auction.  In December 2021, the New York Climate Action Council approved a draft Scoping Plan for New York’s GHG reduction strategy. Among the included emission reduction opportunities, it opened discussion for carbon pricing.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/109,SubNational,,Buildings,,,,ICAP
USA - North Carolina,,USA,"North Carolina’s Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) released the “Clean Energy Plan” (CEP) in 2019 to outline policy recommendations to reach the state’s GHG reduction targets of 40% below 2005 levels by 2025 (Executive Order No. 80) and of 50% by 2030 (Executive Order No. 246). A core component of the CEP is to reduce electricity sector GHG emissions to 70% below 2005 levels by 2030 and attain overall carbon neutrality by 2050.  The DEQ commissioned an academic report to evaluate policy options to decarbonize the electricity sector, released in March 2021. The report lists the introduction of an ETS and participation in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) as an option to achieve the reductions sought.  In July 2021, North Carolina’s Environmental Management Commission (EMC) instructed the DEQ to start a rulemaking process to establish an ETS that is consistent with the design features of the Model Rule of the RGGI. Aligning the system’s design features to that of RGGI would enable the state to join the regional initiative.  According to the Air Quality Committee Meeting outcomes, any start date before 2023 is unlikely due to the length of the rulemaking process.  In October of 2021, North Carolina (NC) passed House Bill (HB) 951 which requires the NC Utilities Commission to take all reasonable steps to reduce CO2 emissions by 70% by 2030, compared with 2005 levels, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. It allows for 5% of the reductions to be achieved through the use of offsets rather than actual reductions. It also allows for financing early retirement of coal-fired power plants via securitization. Lastly, electric public utilities receive some freedom in rate making in order to address emission reduction needs (e.g. multi-year rate making, decoupling rate making and performance-based rate making). The CO2 reductions must be achieved following a least cost path.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/110,SubNational,,,,,,ICAP
USA - Oregon,,USA,"In December 2021, the Environmental Quality Commission (EQC) adopted the rules for the Climate Protection Program (CCP) which started in January 2022. The CPP places a declining limit on GHG emissions from suppliers of liquid fuels and propane and natural gas utilities, also dubbed local distribution companies.   Each year the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) will distribute free compliance instruments to fuel suppliers according to the declining cap. After every compliance period (three years), entities will have to surrender compliance instruments to cover their emissions. Entities can bank compliance instruments for future periods or trade their unused instruments with other covered entities.   For the first compliance period (2022-2024), covered suppliers may cover up to 10% of their compliance obligations with community climate investment credits (CCI), which are earned by contributing funds to third-party entities to implement projects that reduce GHG emissions in Oregon. Funds may only be contributed to DEQ-approved third parties called CCI entities. Priorities include reducing emissions at least one MtCO2e on average per CCI credit, reducing non-GHG emissions, promoting benefits for environmental justice communities, and accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to low carbon energy sources.

USA - Pennsylvania,,USA,"In October 2019, Pennsylvania’s Governor Tom Wolf signed an executive order directing the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection (DEP) to develop and present to the Environmental Quality Board (EQB) a proposal for an ETS covering CO2 emissions from the electric power sector and its linkage to the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). According to the executive order, the legal basis for developing an ETS is the state’s ‘Air Pollution Control Act,’ which regulates air resources necessary for the protection of public health. In January 2020, the DEP released a first draft proposal for a power sector ETS covering CO2 emissions. An update to the proposal in April 2020 proposed an emissions cap of 78 MtCO2 for 2022 that would decrease annually by 3% to 58.1 MtCO2 in 2030. In September 2020, the DEP released and presented to the EQB a draft ETS regulation based on the draft proposal. As Pennsylvania aims to join RGGI, for which one precondition is to align ETS program design accordingly, the DEP-proposed regulation is largely consistent with the system design features of the RGGI Model Rule. This includes the implementation of an emissions containment reserve and a cost containment reserve, as well as quarterly auctions to allocate allowances. It includes additional features such as a waste-coal set-aside account, a set-aside provision for cogeneration units (including combined heat and power systems), and a limited exemption for cogeneration units that supply less than 15% of their total energy to the electricity grid.The draft regulation went through public consultation between November 2020 and January 2021. A final regulation was approved by the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection's (DEP) Environmental Quality Board (EQB) in July 2021. In April 2022, the final regulation to establish an ETS in Pennsylvania and to join RGGI was published. Under the regulation, covered entities in Pennsylvania had to begin accounting for their emissions as of 1 July 2022. However, shortly after its publication, the regulation was disputed by a collection of local coal stakeholders, including power plant owners, coal mine owners, and workers unions, who filed lawsuits in front of the Commonwealth Court. The final ruling is still pending. Until further action by the courts is taken, the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection will not take steps to implement or enforce the RGGI regulation.  Joining RGGI would require negotiations between Pennsylvania and the current RGGI member states to adjust the program’s emissions cap. With Pennsylvania joining RGGI, the initiative’s carbon market would increase significantly, as Pennsylvania’s share of emissions in the 2022 RGGI cap would amount to 40.2%. Other major emission reduction efforts currently under development in Pennsylvania include: • a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between Pennsylvania and six other states to develop an action plan for the buildout of regional CO2 transport infrastructure to enable large-scale carbon management; and • a rulemaking which would establish a requirement for automobile manufacturers to offer zero emissions vehicles (ZEVs) as a percentage of their fleet.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/107,SubNational,,,,,,ICAP
USA - Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI),2010,USA,"The Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) is the first mandatory GHG ETS in the United States and covers emissions from the power sector. The system started operating in 2009 with ten states (Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Vermont). Its development was based on the “2005 RGGI Memorandum of Understanding” (MOU) and on the “2006 RGGI Model Rule”. Through statutes or regulations based on the Model Rule, each state then established individual CO2 budget trading programs. After withdrawing from RGGI at the end of the first control period in December 2011, New Jersey renewed its participation in 2020, while Virginia joined in 2021.   RGGI has gone through two review processes that updated the Model Rule and enshrined tighter caps and adjustments to system design. Between 2021 and 2030, the RGGI cap will reduce by 30% compared to 2020.

In February 2021, Connecticut, Washington (D.C.), Massachusetts, and Rhode Island signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) formalizing their participation in a cap-and-invest program, the Transportation and Climate Initiative Program (TCI-P). The program includes the auctioning of emission allowances with a cap that declines over time. The proceeds will be invested by the participating jurisdictions to further reduce GHG emissions and other air pollutants.  TCI-P caps CO2 emissions from the combustion of gasoline and on-road diesel fuel in the participating areas.

USA - Washington,,USA,"In May 2021, Governor Jay Inslee signed into law the “Climate Commitment Act” (CCA), which puts in place an economy-wide cap-and-invest program that begins January 2023. Washington is the second state in the United States to pass a law requiring such a program, after California. Washington will not be linked to any other jurisdictions at its start, but the CCA allows for linkage in the future if certain conditions are met.  Entities that emit more than 25,000 tCO2e/year must acquire allowances for their emissions to meet a cap that decreases proportionally to Washington’s GHG limits. These include industrial facilities, in-state electricity producers, electricity importers, natural gas distributors and fuel suppliers. In 2027, the program will add waste-to-energy facilities, and landfills and railroad companies in 2031. Uncovered entities that wish to participate in the program can do so by registering as an opt-in entity or as a general market participant. Covered entities that fail to comply with their obligations will be subject to fines up to USD 10,000 per day.  The Washington Department of Ecology is the administrative authority for the program and will adopt annual allowance budgets to be distributed through a combination of auctions and free allocation. Washington joined the Western Climate Initiative, Inc., in December 2021, and that organization will provide the trading platform and technical services and support for Washington’s cap-and-invest program. The Department will conduct auctions as often as quarterly, as well as additional reserve auctions in the event of prices reaching an auction price ceiling. The CCA also contains market stability measures such an allowance price containment reserve, an emissions containment reserve, and an auction floor price.   Through at least 2035, emissions-intensive trade-exposed industries (EITE) will receive free allowances based either on their carbon intensity baselines, multiplied by their yearly production or, in some cases, on their baseline historical CO2e emissions, regardless of changes in production volumes. From the second compliance period, starting in 2027, free allocation will be adjusted according to benchmark reduction schedules.   Covered entities will be able to cover up to 5% of their compliance obligations with offset credits through 2026, and up to 4% from 2027 to 2030. Covered entities will be able to cover their obligations for up to an additional 3% with units from offset projects on Tribal Lands through 2026, and with up to 2% additional from 2027 to 2030. Available allowances must be reduced in an amount equivalent to offset use.  Allowance auction proceeds can be invested in initiatives to decarbonize transportation and other sectors of the economy, promote clean energy, and advance equity and environmental justice. The CCA attempts to ensure that all communities will benefit from decarbonization. For example, at least 35% of investments will be dedicated towards overburdened communities and an additional 10% directed towards Tribes.   Through 2022, the Department of Ecology is developing the rules to implement the CCA, including: the main cap-and-invest program rules; the criteria for determining emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries; and updated rules for GHG emissions reporting.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/85,SubNational,,,,,,ICAP
Vietnam ,,Viet Nam,"In November 2021, Vietnam’s revised “Law on Environmental Protection” was issued. The Law establishes a mandate for the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment (MONRE) and for the Ministry of Finance to design a national crediting mechanism (NCM) and a domestic ETS. The framework legislation also empowers MONRE to set the ETS cap and determine the method of allowance allocation and allows for the inclusion of domestic and international offsets in the ETS.   In January 2022, the Government of Vietnam issued “Decree 06/2022/ND-CP”, which provides regulations under the “Law on Environmental Protection” and outlines a roadmap for the implementation of the NCM and the ETS. The decree requires facilities with annual GHG emissions above 3,000 tCO2e to submit a biennial inventory report of their emissions from 2025 onwards (for example, in 2025 the facility must submit an inventory report covering emissions from 2024). The accompanying “Decision 01/2022/QD-TTg” lists the sectors and facilities with emissions inventory obligations.   The Decree also includes provisions for developing a national ETS, focusing initially on the steel, cement, and thermal power sectors, with a declining cap corresponding to Vietnam’s NDC. The roadmap for the NCM laid out in the Decree envisages that the legal framework and technical foundations should be in place by 2023, and that a pilot NCM can take place between 2023 and 2024, focusing on the solid waste and transport sectors. From 2026, the NCM and crediting mechanisms under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement should be fully implemented in the country.   For the ETS, the roadmap states that ETS regulations and a trading platform should be in place by 2025. A pilot voluntary ETS is planned to take place between 2026 and 2027. The mandatory ETS should be implemented from 2028 onwards and will be designed to link with others under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.",https://icapcarbonaction.com/en/ets_system/83,National,,,,,,ICAP
